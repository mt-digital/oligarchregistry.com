Thank you for the email, however, in briefly reviewing LM's responses, she mentions a Dr. Rishard. I have previously 
asked your office to provide Dr. Rishard's contact information. I have looked for an "Office of Palm Beach Doctors" and 
and a "Dr. Rishard" and have been unable to locate either. Please provide me with contact information so that I may 
obtain records. Thank you.

Brad — 
In your answers to ROGS, you list Milton Center for girls as facility that Jane Doe attended. Milton Center is a 
Department of Juvenile Justice facility; therefore I will need to get her records from DJJ. DJJ will not release the records 
without a signed release by Jane Doe. I have attached a general HIPPA release for your review. Would you please have 
Jane Doe sign it? DJJ does not have a standard form. 
Also, will you agree to one more week on Responses to Net Wirth ROGS?? 
Please let me know.

Jeffrey mentioned to me you are looking to pick up an interest in a Hawker 800 XP. I recently exchanged my fractional 
interest for a jet pass card but I may know some other people who might want to sell their interests at a bargain 
price. Also, Jeffrey's and my friend, Benny Shabtai is looking to partner with someone to pick up a plane in today's 
depressed market, but he is looking for someone to pick up a 50% interest. 
Look forward to hearing from you.

HD: Wall Street, Take Two 
DEK: In the upcoming sequel to Oliver Stone's groundbreaking film, Gordon Gekko gets out of jail and back 
to business. Peggy Siegal takes us behind the scenes where she got herself on camera along with a few of her 
famous friends. Nice work if you can get it. 
In 1987, right after director Oliver Stone won the Academy Award for "Platoon," he immediately turned to a 
domestic arena and began working on "Wall Street" in New York City where his father had been a 
stockbroker. Although the film was widely seen as a scathing critique of the culture of Wall Street, Stone has 
said that part of the film is a defense of capitalism, his father's vision of finance (as seen through the Hal 
Holbrook character) and an homage to his father. 
At the time Oliver was also fascinated with the connection between the psyche of Latino Miami drug dealers 
from his earlier "Scarface" script and the American-born 28- to 35-year-old, white collar stockbrokers. Both 
groups had an animalistic need to obtain big and fast money. They shared an obsession with corruption and 
greed. 
Oliver sent his actors to Bear Stearns for research, including then-newcomer Charlie Sheen, who played Bud 
Fox, a kid from nowhere. When he learns to cold call, and lands one big client, Gordon Gekko, Fox is thrust 
into the fast lane with a rock star financial mentor who teaches him corruption. 
Oliver needed an old-fashioned villain to create drama, and he cast Michael Douglas as Gekko against type. 
Michael was not known as a heavy at the time, but as a charming, handsome, sensitive leading man. Oliver 
also saw the anger, confidence, salesmanship and style that Michael brought to the role. Michael's Gekko 
looked a bit like Laker's coach Pat Riley with his slicked back hair and well-cut suits, and it became Michael's 
most important role, winning him the Academy Award for the villain no one could ever forget. 
When Gekko delivers his speech, "Greed, for lack of a better word, is good. Greed is right. Greed works," 
cinematic history was made. 
"Wall Street" was set in 1985, a time before ten financial news networks broadcasting 24/7 existed. The entire 
financial services industry was largely unknown and Oliver Stone nailed it. 
Four years ago, Wall Street's producer Ed Pressman decided it was time for a sequel and met with Fox Film 
Entertainment co-chairmen Tom Rothman and Jim Gianopulos. Michael Douglas was immediately on-board 
pending script approval. Steven Schiff wrote the first script before the global economic crash of 2008 rendered 
it obsolete. 
Alan Loeb was brought in for a rewrite. Pressman asked me to meet Loeb at the Carlyle Hotel to explain the 
social rhythms of New York's financial high society. Whereas Gekko's character was modeled after '70s junk 
bond kings (Michael Milken) and '80s mergers and acquisitions killers (Henry Kravis), Loeb bases the new 
villain on hedge fund billionaires like John Paulson and Mike Novogratz, geniuses who have created 
stratospheric wealth beyond Gordon Gekko's wildest dreams. When Oliver Stone agreed to direct, he rewrote a 
portion of the script to focus on bankers as well as hedge funders, taking no screen credit. 
This past September, Oliver yelled, "action" as Gordon Gekko, with long grey hair, comes back to life as he 
emerges from a lengthy prison stint shot outside of Sing Sing in Ossining, New York. Gekko is desperate to 
redefine himself in a different era. The New York Post runs a full-page photo of Gekko and New Yorkers 
immediately become obsessed with the filming of Wall Street 2. 
A week into shooting, a glorious fall day. Ed Pressman invites me on the set at the Central Park Zoo. Oliver 
designs an elaborate tracking shot around the seal pool where Gekko, fresh from jail, walks and talks to Jake 
Moore, a young idealistic investment banker played by Shia LaBoeuf. They discuss Gekko's daughter Winnie, 
Moore's fiancée, played by Carrie Mulligan, who is also having an off-screen romance with LaBoeuf. Oliver 
played Cupid. Moore invites Gekko to the Alzheimer's Ball at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Gekko, who 
used to be a sponsor or honoree of such events, cannot even afford a ticket. 
The shot starts with a barking seal jumping for fish, then pans down to the actors. Extras weave in and out. In 
one take Michael makes a wrong turn and ends up at the monkey house. Everyone laughs. The atmosphere on 
the set is courteous but quick and tense. There is pressure when you are making a sequel to a hit. 
I watch the action on monitors while sitting on the producers' canvas chairs with Pressman, Eric Kopeloff 
("Monsters Ball") and Celia Costas, who was a location manager on the first "Wall Street." They have asked 
me to be an extra in the Alzheimer's Ball scene and bring some friends to play rich Upper East Side socialites. 
Oliver wants over the top glam, go-to-the-vault jewels and couture gowns. "Give me the night before the 
Titanic goes down," were his exact words. Not a problem. 
I pay a quick visit to Michael in his trailer on Fifth Avenue where he is resting. We go way back. I was his 
personal publicist when he won the Golden Globe and Oscar for Best Actor for "Wall Street" and we have 
remained great friends. Gekko is just as challenging for him the second time because of endless pages of 
technical financial dialogue. We discuss Catherine Zeta-Jones' Broadway debut in a "Little Night Music." 
Michael has a stack of partially finished handwritten thank you notes next to him for gifts received for 
their shared birthday party on September 25th at the St. Regis. Her 40th and his 65th. 
I tell him I have been cast as an extra in two scenes and he laughs knowing I am desperate to hang around him 
and the production. 
8:30 a.m. on Wednesday, October 21st, another warm, stunning fall day. I report to the wardrobe trailer on 
65th Street and Madison Avenue. I carry four elaborate cocktail dresses and bags of matching accessories. My 
hair is in rollers. Statuesque Julia Koch walks over from her Park Avenue apartment carrying her white 
Valentino and long diamond earrings. Her real-life financial titan husband David is unaware where she is this 
morning. 
Vanity Fair's keeper of the Best Dressed List, Amy Fine Collins, arrives totally organized in turquoise vintage 
Geoffrey Beene, and Vogue's fashion editor Hamish Bowles wears a riot of plaids, patterns and a large yellow 
fake flower on his lapel. Costume Designer Ellen Mirojnick, who created Gordon Gekko's rich slick look in the 
first film, is ecstatic with the extras I invited. 
Oliver is shooting a scene with Josh Brolin (the star of Stone's "W"). His character Bretton (never Bret) 
James, a ruthless Wall Street kingpin, and his perfect wife Samantha (Noelle Beck) are hosting a benefit piano 
recital for a 13-year-old child prodigy in their huge, art-filled townhouse at 41 East 65th Street. The building 
actually belongs to Baby Jane Holzer, a wealthy art collector still famous for hanging with Andy Warhol in the 
'60s. The production designer had Jane's fabulous Warhols moved to storage and replaced with matching 
photographic copies. Very expensive contemporary art is again an important production element of Oliver's 
vision. 
At 10:30 a.m., all the extras are placed around the living room set. Oliver's French mother, Jacqueline Stone, 
and her friend Monique Van Vooren, both in their 80s, are seated in front of the fireplace chatting in French. 
Production assistants fuss over them. Debonair macho man Chuck Pfieffer, who appeared in the original film, 
and I immediately invent a back story—I am his corporate wife—and we position ourselves on a couch next to 
the director's mother. Julia gets the best spot close to the piano and Amy, Hamish and decorator Geoffrey 
Bradfield are right behind her. Josh is brought in and the kibitzing stops. 
Oliver appears on the set with eagle eyes and a sly grin and quickly re-positions everyone. He explains the 
scene, gives out lines to his favored extras, and on his way out to the monitors in the next room mentions that 
my earrings are too small. Wardrobe jumps. Josh rehearses and Oliver finally yells, "Action." The kid plays 
the piano, Josh explains why we are in his home, asks for money, the camera dollies as extras say their lines 
and Shia appears at the door uninvited for a confrontation with Josh. Three hours later a PA yells, "Lunch". 
In costume, Amy, Hamish and I run to The Monkey Bar. I am late to meet "The Harpies," including Liz 
Smith, Barbara Walters, Cynthia McFadden, Nora Ephron, Jennifer Isham, Maury Perl and Beth Kseniak. 
Graydon Carter is at the next table. I tell him Oliver Stone wants him in "Wall Street 2" as an extra. (I make 
this up.) Graydon jokes that he only works with lines. I say, "Not a problem." (This will be news to Oliver.) 
Back on the set I tell Oliver that Graydon is willing to be in the film with lines. Oliver finds that intriguing. 
Oliver shoots the piano recital scene over and over again from different angles all afternoon. Financial wizard 
Don Marron saunters on the set to visit and Oliver spontaneously puts him in a scene chatting with Josh. Carrie 
Mulligan hangs out watching boyfriend Shia work. 
At sundown Julia Koch has to race from reel to real life and explain to her husband where she has been all day. 
(He loves it.) 
Chuck Pfieffer plants a "Page Six" item and the next day socialites begin calling me to get into the film. 
Thursday, November 5, Shun Lee Restaurant, West 65th Street 
Oliver shoots a crowded tight interior scene with Michael, Carrie and Shia, who are having an intimate 
Chinese dinner. Spontaneously, Oliver decides this is the perfect scene for Graydon Carter. After a flurry of 
calls, Graydon arrives on set, and playing himself, sashays by the table. Gekko jumps up to say hello and 
Graydon brushes him off with a few dismissive lines. 
Monday, November 9, 25 Broadway 
One hundred swells show up at the former Canard Shipping building, a massive Italianate hall, at the crack of 
dawn for the Alzheimer's Ball, a grand charity event. 
Susan Hess and I are chauffeured downtown with our Vera Wang gowns and report to the VIP extra holding 
area where we join Prince Dimitri of Yugoslavia in a bespoke dinner jacket, journalist Christopher Mason, 
songstress Yanna Avis, photographer Kelly Klein, art dealer Larry Gagosian's girl friend Shala Monroque in 
see-through Rodarte, beauty executive Olivia Chantecaille, producer Lawrence Robins, author Jackie Weld 
Drake, Vogue film critic Joan Juliet Buck, fashion consultant Jill Fairchild, CNN's Felicia Taylor and Italian 
newsman Mario Calvo-Platero. 
Ellen Mirojnick and her costume department have assembled racks of the most expensive elaborate designer 
gowns and work at break neck speed styling while we wildly strip to our undies in a makeshift dressing area. 
Ellen pours me into a black tulle Marchesa with a enormous wired silver bow. Twenty hairdressers and make-
up artists systematically work on 250 extras. A mile of tables are alternately filled with steaming coffee, 
fattening breakfast foods, hair sprays, mirrors, shoes and jewelry. It's a madhouse of excitement. 
We are led to the part of the set used for the cocktail reception and placed around Michael Douglas and Charlie 
Sheen stand-ins. Charlie has been flown in from LA for half a day's work to reprise his original character. He 
is now the highest paid television actor commanding two million dollars an episode of "Two and a Half Men." 
Oliver arrives on the set greeting, examining, tweaking the shot and always pulling the prettiest girls closest to 
the camera. Michael and Charlie arrive from their trailers and run their lines as socials drift into their sight 
lines challenging their concentration on pages of dialogue. Oliver yells, "Action" as the extras aggressively 
jockey for face time. Charlie is not having an easy day and they do take after take. My corporate husband 
Chuck Pfieffer has gotten his real girlfriend Lisa Crosby in the film and my marriage has become a threesome. 
Sensing our concern of not making it onto the silver screen Oliver tells his first assistant director to seat a 
dinner table with Susan Hess, Jill Fairchild, Prince Dimitri, Chuck Pfieffer, Grace Meigher and Mario Calvo-
Platero. He directs us to chat with each other turning left and right as the camera closely pans past our faces. 
Elsewhere on the set are John Buffalo Mailer, as Shia's character's best friend, Austin Pendleton, 94-year-old 
Eli Wallach and Natalie Morales. Also in this film are: the magnificent Frank Langella, as Shia's boss, who 
throws himself in front of a train early in the film, Susan Sarandon as Shia's real-estate broker mother, Sylvia 
Miles, who reprises her hilarious cameo as another real-estate agent and Jean Pigozzi as an international 
banker. 
Lunch is called at 4 p.m. and Michael Douglas takes seven heavily made-up and bejeweled women including 
Susan, Jill and me to a restaurant around the corner. Gordon Gekko hosts a hen party talking about children, 
schools, country houses and vacations. 
Back on the set Oliver is shooting the actual dinner. Assistant directors ask for volunteers to dance to the live 
music. Prince Dimitri twirls and dips Jackie Weld. Kelly Klein, in her own Karl Lagerfeld sheer black organza, 
watches from a table with scattered champagne glasses half-filled with apple juice along with her 86-year-old 
father, Tulley Rector. Charlie Sheen leaves for LA and Shia is very annoyed he was not introduced to his 
hero. Carrie Mulligan, costumed like Audrey Hepburn, chats with us between takes. 
The final set up is a long tracking shot of Josh Brolin and his wife as they triumphantly enter the ball. It is 
close to 9 p.m. and Lord William Astor arrives to pick me up for Amalia Dayan and Adam Lindemann's dinner 
for artists uptown. 
Oliver is introduced to William and delights in calling him Lord as he immediately moves him into the top of 
the shot and instructs him to tell Eli Wallach, "We must do lunch". Ever the proper English gentleman, 
William advises Oliver that Lords do not use American slang and improvises his own lines. The tracking shot 
continues for numerous takes following Josh and NoeIle as every VIP extra gets another shot at instant stardom 
with one-line greetings. 
At last, "It's a wrap" is screamed after 10 p.m. Prince Dimitri tells The Wall Street Journal it was, "a day of 
electrifying glamour," and "the longest gala of my life. I was in black tie for thirteen hours." 
November 25, Tommy Gun Salon, Ludlow Street, last day of shooting 
Donald Trump is on set at 7 a.m. ready for his close up. He is trying to make a mid-day departure on his jet 
from Teterboro with wife Melania and son Baron for Thanksgiving weekend in Palm Beach. Back in 
September, Oliver had invited Donald Trump to dinner at "21" to meet his leading men Josh and Shia so they 
could observe New York's most charismatic powerbroker in his natural environment. 
The scene is London so the grey skies are perfect. Gekko has moved abroad to make his financial 
comeback. The scene opens on the back of his head in a barber's chair as he watches the financial news on TV. 
The camera pulls back and Gordon Gekko is finally revealed as the powerful bull he once was in an exquisite 
suit and signature slicked-back hair. Donald Trump walks into the shop for a cut and the banter begins about 
the money market. From his chair, Donald leans into Michael and suggests a "comb over" like his famous 
do. Gekko, with a slight grin, says, "No thanks Donald, I am a gel man." 
The crew is yucking it up and Donald feels great. Paparazzi shoot the whole scene with long lenses from across 
the street. The unit publicist is helpless to keep this under wraps. Donald emerges, poses and gives interviews. 
Michael comes out, and the press think they have a scoop on the ending. Gekko is back in all his lovable titan 
splendor. Full-page photos of Michael and Donald run the next day in the tabloids. Never underestimate Oliver 
Stone's surprise endings. 
Twentieth Century Fox releases "Wall Street 2: The Money Never Sleeps" on April 23rd and it's got hit written 
all over it.

Oliver is shooting a scene with Josh Brolin (the star of Stone's "W"). His character Bretton (never Bret) James, a ruthless Wall 
Street kingpin, and his perfect wife Samantha (Noelle Beck) are hosting a benefit piano recital for a 13-year-old child prodigy in their 
huge, art-filled townhouse at 41 East 65th Street. The building actually belongs to Baby Jane Holzer, a wealthy art collector still 
famous for hanging with Andy Warhol in the '60s. The production designer had Jane's fabulous Warhols moved to storage and 
replaced with matching photographic copies. Very expensive contemporary art is again an important production element of Oliver's 
vision. 
At 10:30 a.m., all the extras are placed around the living room set. Oliver's French mother, Jacqueline Stone, and her friend 
Monique Van Vooren, both in their 80s, are seated in front of the fireplace chatting in French. Production assistants fuss over them. 
Debonair macho man Chuck Pfieffer, who appeared in the original film, and I immediately invent a back story—I am his corporate 
wife—and we position ourselves on a couch next to the director's mother. Julia gets the best spot close to the piano and Amy, 
Hamish and decorator Geoffrey Bradfield are right behind her. Josh is brought in and the kibitzing stops. 
Oliver appears on the set with eagle eyes and a sly grin and quickly re-positions everyone. He explains the scene, gives out lines 
to his favored extras, and on his way out to the monitors in the next room mentions that my earrings are too small. Wardrobe 
jumps. Josh rehearses and Oliver finally yells, "Action." The kid plays the piano, Josh explains why we are in his home, asks for 
money, the camera dollies as extras say their lines and Shia appears at the door uninvited for a confrontation with Josh. Three hours 
later a PA yells, "Lunch". 
In costume, Amy, Hamish and I run to The Monkey Bar. I am late to meet "The Harpies," including Liz Smith, Barbara 
Walters, Cynthia McFadden, Nora Ephron, Jennifer Isham, Maury Perl and Beth Kseniak. 
Graydon Carter is at the next table. I tell him Oliver Stone wants him in "Wall Street 2" as an extra. (I make this up.) Graydon 
jokes that he only works with lines. I say, "Not a problem." (This will be news to Oliver.) 
Back on the set I tell Oliver that Graydon is willing to be in the film with lines. Oliver finds that intriguing. 
Oliver shoots the piano recital scene over and over again from different angles all afternoon. Financial wizard Don Marron 
saunters on the set to visit and Oliver spontaneously puts him in a scene chatting with Josh. Carrie Mulligan hangs out watching 
boyfriend Shia work. 
At sundown Julia Koch has to race from reel to real life and explain to her husband where she has been all day. (He loves it.) 
Chuck Pfieffer plants a "Page Six" item and the next day socialites begin calling me to get into the film. 
Thursday, November 5, Shun Lee Restaurant, West 65th Street 
Oliver shoots a crowded tight interior scene with Michael, Carrie and Shia, who are having an intimate Chinese dinner. 
Spontaneously, Oliver decides this is the perfect scene for Graydon Carter. After a flurry of calls, Graydon arrives on set, and playing 
himself, sashays by the table. Gekko jumps up to say hello and Graydon brushes him off with a few dismissive lines. 
Monday, November 9, 25 Broadway 
One hundred swells show up at the former Canard Shipping building, a massive Italianate hall, at the crack of dawn for the 
Alzheimer's Ball, a grand charity event. 
Susan Hess and I are chauffeured downtown with our Vera Wang gowns and report to the VIP extra holding area where we join 
Prince Dimitri of Yugoslavia in a bespoke dinner jacket, journalist Christopher Mason, songstress Yanna Avis, photographer Kelly 
Klein, art dealer Larry Gagosian's girl friend Shala Monroque in see-through Rodarte, beauty executive Olivia Chantecaille, producer 
Lawrence Robins, author Jackie Weld Drake, Vogue film critic Joan Juliet Buck, fashion consultant Jill Fairchild, CNN's Felicia 
Taylor and Italian newsman Mario Calvo-Platero. 
Ellen Mirojnick and her costume department have assembled racks of the most expensive elaborate designer gowns and work at 
break neck speed styling while we wildly strip to our undies in a makeshift dressing area. Ellen pours me into a black tulle Marchesa 
with a enormous wired silver bow. Twenty hairdressers and make-up artists systematically work on 250 extras. A mile of tables are 
alternately filled with steaming coffee, fattening breakfast foods, hair sprays, mirrors, shoes and jewelry. It's a madhouse of 
excitement. 
We are led to the part of the set used for the cocktail reception and placed around Michael Douglas and Charlie Sheen stand-ins. 
Charlie has been flown in from LA for half a days work to reprise his original character. He is now the highest paid television actor 
commanding two million dollars an episode of "Two and a Half Men." 
Oliver arrives on the set greeting, examining, tweaking the shot and always pulling the prettiest girls closest to the 
camera. Michael and Charlie arrive from their trailers and run their lines as socials drift into their sight lines challenging their 
concentration on pages of dialogue. Oliver yells, "Action" as the extras aggressively jockey for face time. Charlie is not having an 
easy day and they do take after take. My corporate husband Chuck Pfieffer has gotten his real girlfriend Lisa Crosby in the film and 
my marriage has become a threesome. 
Sensing our concern of not making it onto the silver screen Oliver tells his first assistant director to seat a dinner table with 
Susan Hess, Jill Fairchild, Prince Dimitri, Chuck Pfieffer, Grace Meigher and Mario Calvo-Platero. He directs us to chat with each 
other turning left and right as the camera closely pans past our faces. 
Elsewhere on the set are John Buffalo Mailer, as Shia's character's best friend, Austin Pendleton, 94-year-old Eli Wallach and 
Natalie Morales. Also in this film are: the magnificent Frank Langella, as Shia's boss, who throws himself in front of a train early in 
the film, Susan Sarandon as Shia's real-estate broker mother, Sylvia Miles, who reprises her hilarious cameo as another real-estate 
agent and Jean Pigozzi as an international banker. 
Lunch is called at 4 p.m. and Michael Douglas takes seven heavily made-up and bejeweled women including Susan, Jill and me 
to a restaurant around the corner. Gordon Gekko hosts a hen party talking about children, schools, country houses and vacations. 
Back on the set Oliver is shooting the actual dinner. Assistant directors ask for volunteers to dance to the live music. Prince 
Dimitri twirls and dips Jackie Weld. Kelly Klein, in her own Karl Lagerfeld sheer black organza, watches from a table with scattered 
champagne glasses half-filled with apple juice along with her 86-year-old father, Tulley Rector. Charlie Sheen leaves for LA and 
Shia is very annoyed he was not introduced to his hero. Carrie Mulligan, costumed like Audrey Hepburn, chats with us between 
takes. 
The final set up is a long tracking shot of Josh Brolin and his wife as they triumphantly enter the ball. It is close to 9 p.m. and 
Lord William Astor arrives to pick me up for Amalia Dayan and Adam Lindemann's dinner for artists uptown. 
Oliver is introduced to William and delights in calling him Lord as he immediately moves him into the top of the shot and 
instructs him to tell Eli Wallach, "We must do lunch". Ever the proper English gentleman, William advises Oliver that Lords do not 
use American slang and improvises his own lines. The tracking shot continues for numerous takes following Josh and Noelle as 
every VIP extra gets another shot at instant stardom with one-line greetings. 
At last, "It's a wrap" is screamed after 10 p.m. Prince Dimitri tells The Wall Street Journal it was, "a day of electrifying 
glamour," and "the longest gala of my life. I was in black tie for thirteen hours." 
November 25, Tommy Gun Salon, Ludlow Street, last day of shooting 
Donald Trump is on set at 7 a.m. ready for his close up. He is trying to make a mid-day departure on his jet from Teterboro 
with wife Melania and son Baron for Thanksgiving weekend in Palm Beach. Back in September, Oliver had invited Donald Trump to 
dinner at "21" to meet his leading men Josh and Shia so they could observe New York's most charismatic powerbroker in his natural 
environment. 
The scene is London so the grey skies are perfect. Gekko has moved abroad to make his financial comeback. The scene opens 
on the back of his head in a barber's chair as he watches the financial news on TV. The camera pulls back and Gordon Gekko is 
finally revealed as the powerful bull he once was in an exquisite suit and signature slicked-back hair. Donald Trump walks into the 
shop for a cut and the banter begins about the money market. From his chair, Donald leans into Michael and suggests a "comb over" 
like his famous do. Gekko, with a slight grin, says, "No thanks Donald, I am a gel man." 
The crew is yucking it up and Donald feels great. Paparazzi shoot the whole scene with long lenses from across the street. The 
unit publicist is helpless to keep this under wraps. Donald emerges, poses and gives interviews. Michael comes out, and the press 
think they have a scoop on the ending. Gekko is back in all his lovable titan splendor. Full-page photos of Michael and Donald run 
the next day in the tabloids. Never underestimate Oliver Stone's surprise endings. 
Twentieth Century Fox releases "Wall Street 2: The Money Never Sleeps" on April 23rd and its got hit written all over it.

Inside Job (2010) 
NYT Critics' PickThis movie has been designated a Critic's Pick by the film reviewers of The New York 
Times. 
Sony Pictures Classics 
Henry Paulson, Ben Bernanke and Timothy Geithner in the documentary "Inside Job." 
Who Maimed the Economy, and How 
By A. 0. SCOTT 
"Inside Job," a sleek, briskly paced film whose title suggests a heist movie, is the story of a crime 
without punishment, of an outrage that has so far largely escaped legal sanction and societal stigma. The 
betrayal of public trust and collective values that Mr. Ferguson chronicles was far more brazen and 
damaging than the adultery in Nathaniel Hawthorne's novel, which treated Hester more as scapegoat than 
villain. 
The gist of this movie, which begins in a mood of calm reflection and grows angrier and more incredulous 
as it goes on, is unmistakably punitive. The density of information and the complexity of the subject 
matter make "Inside Job" feel like a classroom lecture at times, but by the end Mr. Ferguson has summoned 
the scourging moral force of a pulpit-shaking sermon. That he delivers it with rigor, restraint and good 
humor makes his case all the more devastating. 
He is hardly alone in making it. Numerous journalists have published books and articles retracing the 
paths that led the world economy to the precipice two years ago. The deregulation of the financial 
services industry in the 1980s and '90s; the growing popularity of complex and risky derivatives; the 
real estate bubble and the explosion of subprime lending — none of these developments were exactly 
secret. On the contrary, they were celebrated as vindications of the power and wisdom of markets. 
Accordingly, Mr. Ferguson recycles choice moments of triumphalism, courtesy of Lawrence H. Summers, 
George W. Bush, Alan Greenspan and various cable television ranters and squawkers. 
Even as stock indexes soared and profits swelled, there were always at least a few investors, economists 
and government officials who warned that the frenzied speculation was leading to the abyss. Some of these 
prophets without honor show up in front of Mr. Ferguson's camera, less to gloat than to present, once 
again, the analyses that were dismissed and ignored by their peers for so long. 
Dozens of interviews — along with news clips and arresting aerial shots of New York, Iceland and other 
disaster areas — are folded into a clear and absorbing history, narrated by Matt Damon. The music (an 
opening song, "Big Time," by Peter Gabriel, and a score by Alex Heffes) and the clean wide-screen 
cinematography provide an aesthetic polish that is welcome for its own sake and also important to the 
movie's themes. The handsomely lighted and appointed interiors convey a sense of the rarefied, privileged 
worlds in which the Wall Street operators and their political enablers flourished, and the elegance of 
the presentation also subliminally bolsters the film's authority. This is not a piece of ragged 
muckraking or breathless advocacy. It rests its outrage on reason, research and careful argument. 
The same was true of Mr. Ferguson's previous documentary, "No End in Sight," which focused on 
catastrophic policies carried out in Iraq by President George W. Bush's administration just after the 
overthrow of Saddam Hussein. But whereas that film concentrated on a narrow view of a complex subject — 
the conduct of the war rather than the at least equally controversial rationale for fighting it — "Inside 
Job" offers a sweeping synthesis, going as far back as the Reagan administration and as far afield as 
Iceland in its anatomy of the financial crisis. 
Perhaps unsurprisingly, many of the highest-profile players declined to be interviewed. Mr. Summers 
appears only in news footage, and none of his predecessors or successors as Treasury secretary — not 
Robert E. Rubin or Henry M. Paulson Jr. or Timothy F. Geithner — submit to Mr. Ferguson's questions. Nor 
do any of the top executives at Goldman Sachs or the other big banks. Most of the interviewees are, at 
least from the perspective of the filmmaker, friendly witnesses, adding fuel to the director's 
comprehensive critique of the way business has been done in the United States and the other advanced 
capitalist countries for the past two decades. 
Both American political parties are indicted; "Inside Job" is not simply another belated settling of 
accounts with Mr. Bush and his advisers, though they are hardly ignored. The scaling back of government 
oversight and the weakening of checks on speculative activity by banks began under Reagan and continued 
during the Clinton administration. And with each administration the market in derivatives expanded, and 
alarms about the dangers of this type of investment were ignored. Raghuram Rajan, chief economist at the 
International Monetary Fund, presented a paper in 2005 warning of a "catastrophic meltdown" and was 
mocked as a "Luddite" by Mr. Summers. 
Meanwhile, some investment bankers — at Goldman Sachs in particular — were betting against the positions 
they were pushing on their customers. An elaborate house of cards had been constructed in which bad 
consumer loans were bundled into securities, which, were certified as sound by rating agencies paid by 
the banks and then insured via credit-default swaps. One risky bet was stacked on top of another, and in 
retrospect the collapse of the whole edifice, along with the loss of jobs, homes, pensions and political 
confidence, seems inevitable. 
How did this happen? Mr. Ferguson is no conspiracy theorist; nor is he inclined toward structural or 
systemic explanations. Markets are not like tectonic plates, shifting on their own. Visible hands write 
laws and make deals, and in this case a combination of warped values and groupthink seems to have driven 
very intelligent men (and they were mostly men) toward folly. In addition to business and government, Mr. 
Ferguson aims his critique at academia, suggesting that the discipline of economics and more than a few 
prominent economists were corrupted by consulting fees, seats on boards of directors and membership in 
the masters of the universe club. 
when he challenges some of these professors, in particular those who held positions of responsibility in 
the white House or in the Federal Reserve, they are reduced to stammering obfuscation — markets are 
complicatedl Who could have predicted? I don't see any conflict of interest — and occasionally provoked 
to testiness. Mr. Ferguson, for his part, cannot always contain his incredulity or rein in his sarcasm. 
occasionally his voice pipes up from off camera, saying things like, "You can't be serious!" 
But it is hard to imagine a movie more serious, and more urgent, than "Inside Job." There are a few 
avenues that might have been explored more thoroughly, in particular the effects of the crisis on 
ordinary, non-wall-street-connected workers and homeowners. The end of the film raises a disturbing 
question, as Mr. Damon exhorts viewers to demand changes in the status quo so that the trends associated 
with unchecked speculation of the kind that caused the last crisis — rising inequality, neglect of 
productive capacity, endless cycles of boom and bust — might be reversed. 
This call to arms makes you wonder why anger of the kind so eloquently expressed in "Inside Job" has been 
so inchoate. And through no fault of its own, the film may leave you dispirited as well as enraged. Its 
fate is likely to be that of other documentaries: praised in some quarters, nitpicked in others and 
shrugged off by those who need its message most. Which is a shame. 
"Inside Job" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Some drug and sex references and pervasive 
obscenity, though not the verbal kind.

question, as Mr. Damon exhorts viewers to demand changes in the status quo so that the trends associated 
with unchecked speculation of the kind that caused the last crisis — rising inequality, neglect of 
productive capacity, endless cycles of boom and bust — might be reversed. 
This call to arms makes you wonder why anger of the kind so eloquently expressed in "Inside Job" has been 
so inchoate. And through no fault of its own, the film may leave you dispirited as well as enraged. Its 
fate is likely to be that of other documentaries: praised in some quarters, nitpicked in others and 
shrugged off by those who need its message most. Which is a shame. 
"Inside Job" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Some drug and sex references and pervasive 
obscenity, though not the verbal kind.

I have heard some things about it. 
B of A has note on house and the land across the street now subdivided into lots (a few acres each) called Vineyard 
Estates. 
Farm Credit Bank has note on winery and equipment. 
Trump has tried to make a deal with the lenders but didnt. He may bid. 
I'll find out current status.

Paul Rampell does act as Donald Trump's attorney for some personal, real estate and Town of PB matters. James Green 
of WPB also does work for Trump (like the American flag matter) usually through Rampell. I think another firm was doing 
the airport flight path and expansion matter.

Sean very discussed with me this company was interested, unless he call you,. 
From Sean: 
This buyer did have specs on your aircraft. They were looking at a 3.0 million budget but did not make 
an offer and it was too low. We did discuss it

! need to start off by stating that it is not my intent to go around Shawn Lancaster on this — Shawn is a friend. 
This being said, I have received e-mails from both you and Larry this weekend. 
I called Larry and he said I should send you an e-mail. 
I called a close friend of mine inquiring about the GV market and aircraft that are "not published". As of today, 
there are eight (8) of these aircraft that are not yet on the market. 
Let me know if you would like to speak with him and by what means (you call him, he call you, call 
Larry ....whatever). 
By the way, his company sold Trumps 727 and got Trump a very attractive number for an aircraft that was on 
it's way to a museum. 
Hope all is well.

Eric Roth

This week we're thinking a little more... adventurously, from active escapes at Travaasa Hana in Maui to racecar driving in Baja and hiking Moab with the experts at Austin-Lehman Adventures.

Sitting on 50 wild acres of jungle by the beach, this striking Italian-style villa has white sand-colored interiors that match the serene beach outside. The Duchess of Ferrari originally built this tropical hideaway on Mexico's fabled Yucatan Peninsula in the early 1990s to entertain her globetrotting friends. It has since been remade as a 29-room boutique wonder, where that local culture is so intrinsic to the design that it can be found in the minutest details.

Some people do yoga on vacation; others go for the occasional run. This week we're thinking a little more... adventurously, from active escapes at Travaasa Hana in Maui to racecar driving in Baja and hiking Moab with the experts at Austin-Lehman Adventures. And after all that action, chill out with stays at the new Dream South Beach, the gorgeous Pavilions Phuket and other luxe resorts worldwide.

	This South Beach newcomer lives up to the hype. Set in two landmark Art Deco buildings on Collins Avenue, right behind the former Versace Mansion, the boutique hotel has 108 sleek guestrooms washed in blue and white, and access to soft, sandy beaches, a restaurant helmed by chef Geoffrey Zakarian and a hip rooftop pool scene.

Travaasa Hana - Hawaii

	Reinvented from the former Hotel Hana Maui, the brand new Travaasa Hana combines - in concept and name - travel and pravaasa ("memorable journey" in Sanskrit). The mix of adventure, relaxation and truly experiencing a destination are hallmarks of Travaasa. With the beauty of Hana, Hawaii, all around, it's hard to imagine a better marriage of purpose and place.

	It's rare to find a luxury resort as down to earth as this Condé Nast Traveler Hot List alum. Sitting on 50 wild acres of jungle by the beach, this striking Italian-style villa has white sand-colored interiors that match the serene beach outside. The Duchess of Ferrari originally built this tropical hideaway on Mexico's fabled Yucatan Peninsula in the early 1990s to entertain her globetrotting friends. It has since been remade as a 29-room boutique wonder, where that local culture is so intrinsic to the design that it can be found in the minutest details.

	On a nine-mile stretch of Playa Blanca, just 20 minutes from downtown Zihuatanejo, Hotel Las Palmas is unique escape between lush rain forest and the open Pacific Ocean. All 10 suites were individually designed by Enrique Zozaya in a sleek, modern-tropical style and capture the unspoiled views on private terraces and balconies. With the soaring Sierra Madre del Sur mountains in the distance and sleepy fishing village of Barra de Potosi close by, the Hotel Las Palmas is a true barefoot hideaway in a quintessentially Mexican setting.

	There's a lot to love in Long Beach. It's the sixth largest city in California (with nearly half a million people), one half of the western hemisphere's largest port, and it's finally coming into its own as a magnet for travelers. The modern, 138-room AVIA Hotel sits at the epicenter of all the action. And the cheery Long Beach lovers staffing the property are happy to highlight the best of the city.

	It's hard to imagine, but true: Summer will slip away before you know it. Which means it's time for a mini-getaway to one of your favorite cities. And this is the time to go - the streets are quieter, the parks are in bloom and concerts, movies and performances are staged nearly every day. We've got last-minute availability at the Landmark London and three Manhattan standouts: the elegant Hôtel Plaza Athénée, the family-friendly Roger Williams and the über-sleek Thompson LES. Choosing can be tough when the options are so good.

	Located 20 minutes north of Miami Beach in the heart of Aventura, Fairmont Turnberry Isle Resort &amp; Club mixes country club charm with the sleek styling of a boutique hotel. The 392-room property is home to two Raymond Floyd-designed golf courses and the Laguna Pool, which features a water slide, a lazy river and cabanas outfitted with TVs and refrigerators (this is Miami, after all). With its family-friendly vibe, Turnberry Isle falls somewhere between Grossinger's in the Catskills (at its legendary height) and a posh island resort.

	In the city's former stock exchange building, the 306-room Sofitel is retrofitted with streamlined rooms and an intimate brasserie. This Philadelphia gem is where French and American style come together - think Shaker quilts next to spacious marble bathrooms - in the French Quarter of an All-American destination.

	Epic renderings of sandstone and the frothy beauty of the Colorado River form the backdrop for Austin-Lehman's six-day exploration of the Utah desert in and around its fabled adventure capital, Moab. Guests hop on bicycles, bound down the river in rafts, clamber into 4x4s, and, of course, hike into some of the most jaw-dropping geology on the planet. Evenings are as relaxing as the days are active, with a fixed homebase - a lodge set against red-rock cliffs that happens to have its own winery.

	Known as Napa of the North, Canada's Okanagan region is a year-round retreat east of Vancouver. The area is home to award-winning wineries, Canada's warmest lake and a stunning desert landscape fit for golfing virtually every day of the year. With exceptional service and Pueblo-style architecture, Spirit Ridge Vineyard Resort &amp; Spa is just as much a hotel for oenophiles looking to unwind as it is for golf fanatics and families looking to take advantage of mild weather and myriad activities.

	Near swank shops and Houston's art-gallery scene, the Hotel Derek is designed to feel like a superhip home, with 60s-style settees, English wingback chairs and cowhide rugs. The hotel works on the assumption that its guests have the same qualities as the fictional host, Derek: worldliness, a sense of humor and an eye for beauty.

	It starts with a grand entrance: You'll walk in on a three-story staircase as wide as an IMAX screen. A double-sided fireplace and baby grand piano jazz up the lobby while Technicolor furnishings like cherry-red sofas and silver wallpaper add to the whimsical vibe. The Allegro, a Kimpton hotel, is a vibrant example of boutique-style hospitality in Chicago that playfully tips its hat to old-world glamour without ever taking itself too seriously.

	In the mountainous north of the country, just over an hour from Porto, the recently opened Vidago Palace has, in one fell swoop, raised the bar for luxury getaways in Portugal. As far removed from the sun and sand of the touristy Algarve as you can get, this is a destination for the discerning traveler and the lover of fine things, whether they be cigars, hand-painted silk wallpaper, the country's best spa or a championship golf course.

	With 285 rooms, Crete's Candia Maris beachfront resort is large by Greek hotel standards. It shares the space between the large and airy guestrooms, a choice of restaurants and a host of activities, whatever your interest. Waterbabies will love the seven pools and sybarites can camp out in the resort's Thalassotherapy spa. Overlooking Amoudara beach just outside Heraklion, the resort underwent a top-to-bottom renovation five years ago, adding modern style and amenities to this uber-resort.

	Katharine Hepburn and Henry Fonda made this elegant B&amp;B famous in the 1981 film On Golden Pond, but three decades later the 13-acre estate on Squam Lake remains a revered and romantic New Hampshire countryside escape. With unbeatable views of the White Mountains, Manor on Golden Pond has distinctive guestrooms - from the Cotswold Cottage to the Canterbury Manor - plus all the trappings of a sophisticated inn, with the English heritage to back it up.

	Grenada is known as the most gregarious of the Caribbean islands, and Maca Bana, on a secluded cove on the Point Salines peninsula, represents a microcosm of that, from the general manager to the gardener. The boutique villa hotel (appropriately named after a tree in the indigenous Arawak language) has an infinity pool and beachside restaurant to entertain, plus each villa has a deck with a private hot tub. And even though the resort is just five minutes from the airport, it feels worlds away.

High-end yet relaxed, it has sprawling grounds and a full-service attitude that invites total indulgence for guests.

	Skilled in the art of seduction, the Fairmont Royal Pavilion was one of the first great beach hotels to open on Barbados. Refreshed by a major 2010 renovation, this graceful Colonial-style estate makes the most of its location - by day guests swim, sail and cavort along the powdery beach or simply enjoy the views from a private terrace overlooking the water. And by night, one of the island's most elegant tables will be available, where dinner is served with the serenading sounds of the surf.

	This six-day journey with Momentum Adventure explores the wild, stark landscape of the Baja Peninsula, and balances adrenaline-infused outings with relaxation at the iconic One&amp;Only Palmilla. Navigate a Baja Challenger racecar through sand washes, cactus forests and lone beaches; score a hole-in-one at a Jack Nicklaus-designed golf course; and fish for blue marlins in a yacht off the shore. Come evening, sip tequila in a breezy villa that overlooks the Sea of Cortez.

	Over the last decade, Siem Reap, the gateway to Cambodia's magnificent temples of Angkor Wat, has morphed from a dusty backpacker hangout to a picturesque town filled with an array of five-star hotels, artsy boutiques and restaurants oozing with ambience. Service here is some of the finest and friendliest in the region, a trait nowhere more evident than at the all-suite Alila Sothea. The hotel's regal 39 rooms, which surround a glittering slate-and-gold-leaf-tiled pool, offer a tranquil, resort-like atmosphere that's rich with local culture and just 20 minutes by car from Angkor.

	These hilltop retreats are some of Phuket's most romantic crash pads thanks to sublime panoramic Andaman Sea views and the island's most discreet staff. All villas include swimmable pools and roomy decks for sun and shade. The 360 bar attracts the island's best dressed inhabitants who flock here at sundown for the calm view then stay sipping colorful cocktails late into the warm night.

	The best part of staying at the Anantara Bophut - besides the fact that it's on a beautiful Koh Samui beach - is the activities menu, which keeps every type of traveler entertained. Spend mornings windsurfing or learning Thai kickboxing, and afternoons cooking authentic regional dishes or snorkeling in the Gulf of Thailand. If you're craving some slothful downtime, relax next to the giant lagoon-style infinity pool or in the blissful spa.

Art Deco Meets Thai Flair in Sizzling Bangkok

Siam Kempinski Hotel Bangkok

	Though it's just steps from Bangkok's best shopping malls (and the city's notorious traffic-thronged streets), the Siam Kempinski Hotel Bangkok manages to provide a tranquil getaway that feels miles from the city's chaos. Capitalizing on the hotel brand's European roots, the design is an artful blend of Art Deco accents and Thai flourishes. In 303 rooms, huge beds, baths and work/lounge areas provide ample space to recharge, while the amenities - a pool area, a spa and one of the city's best restaurants - offer plenty of excuses to stay close to home.

	Named for James Madison, the fourth president and "father of the Constitution," this stately hotel has traditional style and refined service to match - plus, a location that puts many of Washington's must-see museums and monuments along the National Mall within walking distance. Opened in 1963, the 353-room hotel has hosted the Dalai Lama, the occasional celebrity and every U.S. president since John F. Kennedy except Barack Obama. Not to worry - you can stop by the White House, just five blocks away.

	With 438 newly renovated cream-and-beige rooms (thoughtful details include iPod docks and air purifiers), a quiet and plush restaurant that serves locally-inspired Southern dishes and a beautifully manicured 9,000-square-foot Japanese garden, the Grand Hyatt Atlanta makes a tranquil retreat in the heart of the city's Buckhead District. This is the shopping mecca of the South, so boutiques, plus lots of award-winning restaurants, are all just steps away.

	Built by beer baron Adolphus Busch in 1912 two blocks from Neiman Marcus's flagship store, Dallas's Adolphus Hotel has kept its place as a favorite among distinguished visitors for years. The draw? An Old World aesthetic with traditional furniture and paintings, a hyperattentive staff and an outstanding French restaurant - right in the middle of downtown.

	While Seattle may be one of the smartest cities in the country, its next door neighbor Bellevue is one of the most glamorous. Appealing to both savvy business travelers and couples seeking a romantic respite, Hotel Bellevue is an unassuming retreat in an environment where wealthy residents reign supreme. The property is intimate in size (just 67 rooms), but features luxury amenities in a serene garden setting, just a few blocks from the hustle and bustle of downtown Bellevue.

The "new" is the Dream Downtown NYC, a hip, reinvented space at the crossroads of Chelsea and the Meatpacking District (MePa, if you really must). The "noteworthy" is a little thing called skydiving at Mount Everest. Whether it's lounging poolside in New York or jumping out of a plane in full view of the world's highest mountain, there's a lot going on this week. Read on for all the details, including properties in Paris, San Francisco, Vegas, Miami and more. (Image: Skydive Mount Everest - on sale Sat, Aug 6.)

Housed in a 1960s building designed by Albert C. Ledner, it's situated at the crux of Manhattan's art, design and nightlife scenes between Chelsea and the Meatpacking District. With a hot rooftop bar, a Miami-meets-Ibiza pool (with lounge chairs set in real sand) and modern rooms with classic Downtown views, you can have your party and a good night's sleep, too.

Taking the Plunge

"New and noteworthy" is a term that gets tossed around a lot in the travel world, but we're taking it seriously to heart this week at Jetsetter. The "new" is the Dream Downtown NYC, a hip, reinvented space at the crossroads of Chelsea and the Meatpacking District (MePa, if you really must). The "noteworthy" is a little thing called skydiving at Mount Everest. Whether it's lounging poolside in New York or jumping out of a plane in full view of the world's highest mountain, there's a lot going on this week. Read on for all the details, including properties in Paris, San Francisco, Vegas, Miami and more. (Image: Skydive Mount Everest - on sale Sat, Aug 6.)

Dream Downtown - NYC

	The new Dream Downtown has the best of both worlds. Housed in a 1960s building designed by Albert C. Ledner, it's situated at the crux of Manhattan's art, design and nightlife scenes between Chelsea and the Meatpacking District. With a hot rooftop bar, a Miami-meets-Ibiza pool (with lounge chairs set in real sand) and modern rooms with classic Downtown views, you can have your party and a good night's sleep, too.

	Just a short walk from the Arc de Triomphe, Mon Hotel sits on a quiet street off the bustling boulevards. Designer Aurélia Santoni fashioned this intimate boutique property with eccentricity and flair; lampshades from Dutch design firm Moooi hang above Utrecht armchairs in the lobby. Above all, the style of the guestrooms and the service stress comfort; Mon feels like your personal Paris pied-à-terre.

	Just outside Heraklion, Crete's capital city, the Candia Maris is a sprawling beachside resort spanning nearly 10 acres. Although the property lacks the charm of smaller hotels, it more than compensates with its amenities, which include tennis courts and seven pools. The highlight is the vast thalassotherapy spa, which underwent a multimillion-dollar renovation in 2008.

	In the mountainous north of the country, just over an hour from Porto, the recently opened Vidago Palace has, in one fell swoop, raised the bar for luxury getaways in Portugal. As far removed from the sun and sand of the touristy Algarve as you can get, this is a destination for the discerning traveler and the lover of fine things, whether they be cigars, hand-painted silk wallpaper, the country's best spa or a championship golf course.

	Leisure and business travelers feel like locals at this historic boutique hotel set among the embassies and grand residences of Budapest's tree-lined Andrassy Avenue. Built in 1937 and completely renovated three years ago, the hotel is home to a hip-again Bauhaus style in the comfortable rooms and gourmet dining at on-site Baraka Restaurant. For exploring, you can't beat the location: It's a short walk to restaurants, parks, museums and the city's famed thermal baths.

A Study in Swiss Chic

Cervo - Switzerland

 
 &lt;http://click.mail.jetsetter.com/?qs=253accf39d4210c1af259bf6a9171a6fdc4b1536489462a4ae4a8d71d00b76da81708f6880192587&gt;  
 
	
	The Cervo may have a Swiss address, but there's nothing neutral about this boutique hotel's atmosphere and hospitality. In Zermatt, a legendary ski village where the Matterhorn ("Horu" to locals) dominates the landscape (and the activities, yearround) the hotel has the requisite majestic views. But modern interiors and quirky accents like antlers and cheerful checkerboard patterns make the Cervo a study in Swiss chic.

	In a beautifully renovated redbrick-and-stone former bank building, the Omni San Francisco has an elegant ambiance and draws inspiration from Renaissance Florence. The spacious rooms have carved-mahogany furniture and nine-foot-high crown molded ceilings, while sparkling crystal chandeliers, mahogany paneling and an iron-and-marble staircase define the lobby. Best of all, it's within walking distance from some of the city's top attractions like Union Square, North Beach and Chinatown.

	These hilltop retreats are some of Phuket's most romantic crash pads thanks to sublime panoramic Andaman Sea views and the island's most discreet staff. All villas include swimmable pools and roomy decks for sun and shade. The 360 bar attracts the island's best dressed inhabitants who flock here at sundown for the calm view then stay sipping colorful cocktails late into the warm night.

La Amada Hotel - Playa Mujeres

	Looking more like some millionaire's Miami crib than a traditional Cancún resort, the all white, Zen-minimalist La Amada Hotel exudes a down-to-earth sexiness and an understated elegance - all creamy sofas, gauzy curtains and personal Jacuzzis. Just 20 minutes north of central Cancún in Playa Mujeres, La Amada is on a long, pristine and very secluded beach.

Stately Style in the Heart of Washington D.C.

The Madison - D.C.

 
 &lt;http://click.mail.jetsetter.com/?qs=5a3e483b5a4e626f93944ebb515ea43927977f4221a838085f117622ee1e19dd6688ff060481339e&gt;  
 
	
	Named for James Madison, the fourth president and "father of the Constitution," this stately hotel has traditional style and refined service - plus, a location that puts many of Washington's must-see museums and monuments along the Mall within walking distance. Opened in 1963, the 353-room hotel has hosted the Dalai Lama, the occasional celebrity and every U.S. president since John F. Kennedy except Barack Obama. But don't worry - you can stop by the White House, which is just five blocks away.

Where Esther Williams Meets Chanel

The Raleigh - South Beach

 
 &lt;http://click.mail.jetsetter.com/?qs=a45f50288fa2f4645c444d6bbf219d77fa5b218fc425957b34f89718a9d64ae9c622c25a3ca3018c&gt;  
 
	
	The Raleigh is different from most properties in South Beach, with a vibe that's more Deco cool than decked out to the nines. A stay here feels a bit like a trip to the 1940s - dressed in whites one minute, casual the next. It's all about lounging in style by the pool, which has hosted everything from Esther Williams swimming routines to Chanel's cruise collection show. The Raleigh itself is a lot like that pool: cool, pretty and a place to be seen.

	Shorebreak, a 157-room hotel on Huntington Beach, lives up to the SoCal lifestyle celebrated on breezy beach postcards. From your private balcony, you'll gaze over a classic California coast pier, with the Pacific stretching out behind it. Surf by day, then chow down on room-service orecchiette pasta with seared diver scallops before heading out to a beachside bonfire.

	As any adrenaline junkie knows, skydiving is the ultimate thrill: Those few seconds during free fall are as close to flying as we humans will probably ever get. Now imagine hurling yourself out of a plane at 29,500 feet - in full view of Mount Everest. To call it a rush would be an understatement, but tour company Everest Skydive makes this once-in-a-lifetime experience possible. During this 10-night/11-day tour, beginning in Kathmandu, you'll get your bearings on the ground with some sightseeing and then hike up to the drop site, where the true adventure begins. And with all the details - accommodations, gear, professional instruction - taken care of, skydivers can simply enjoy the (truly unforgettable) moment.

	In the heart of the Madikwe Game Reserve, Morukuru Family's trio of boutique-chic, exclusive lodging options are the perfect pick for small groups seeking an intimate, totally tailor-made bush adventure. Half wild, half unabashedly posh, the getaway is less than a four-hour drive - or an even shorter charter plane ride - from Johannesburg. Choose between the Owners House, the Lodge or the Farm, and the the only people you'll share sundowners and lion cub photos ops with will be the pack you arrived with. Family-friendly and super flexible, this is a true South African safari vacation, complete with personal cooks, butlers and animal trackers at your service.

Dear Jeffrey, 
Recently while refurbishing Donald Trump's 757 I worked closely with his Director of Business Development / 
Special Counsel, Michael Boccio. 
Although I have worked with some very intelligent and creative individuals, Michael is a real stand out — he is 
impressive on many levels. 
Someone (or organization) is going to be excited to have someone with Michael's capabilities working for them 
and thought that you may need someone like Michael on your team or have a friend who may be in search of a 
dynamic individual with his background and talent. 
Please take a moment to read the attached documents to see if Michael is someone you are looking for. If not, 
I ask that you forward this e-mail to someone you believe would greatly benefit by having Michael work for 
them. 
I know that I always appreciate when a friend refers someone who can be of great help to me — personally or in 
business. 
If you have any questions about working with Michael, please do not hesitate to call me. 
Thank you.

strongly. But iPhones these days come with GPS installed, and companies make good money 
furnishing apps that utilize that very feature. On this list: GTX, who offers a pair of $4 GPS 
apps—GPS Tracking and Tracking—that provide workmanlike solutions for users who want to 
keep an electronic eye on their loved ones.

Going Gray-Where Technology's Headed - Entering the Gray-Tech Revolution 
World Market Media - Brittney Barrett - February 16, 2011 
Over the next 20 years, 80 million baby boomers will enter their 
sixties and seventies in the U.S. alone. In the next 40, the number of senior citizens will double. 
For the government, this represents a huge financial burden resultant from rising Medicare and 
Social Security costs. For industries focused on late-life care and creating products that cater to the 
aging demographic; however, this population shift represents a major opportunity.

Walk to Remember? A National Academy of Sciences Study Says Yes 
February 13, 2011 - In healthy adults, the hippocampus — a part of the brain important to the 
formation of memories — begins to atrophy around 55 or 60 and even sooner to an even greater 
degree if one contracts Alzheimer's. Now psychologists are suggesting that the hippocampus can 
be modestly expanded, and memory improved, by nothing more than regular walking.

affliction with the disease. Worse, it's even more difficult to find a missing senior citizen than a

Do you know what the Most Innovative Location Device is? 
No it's not a compass or an astrolabe. It's not semaphore or a smoke signal. Not an RFID tag or a 
neon sign or phosphorous flare either. 
Give up? 
It's the GPS Smart ShoeTM recently mentioned in Forbes Magazine, developed by GTX Corp 
(OTCBB: GTX0.0B) and licensed to Aetrex Worldwide. Yes, a shoe. .well a very smart shoe as 
it can tell a caregiver the precise location, bearing, history, speed and altitude of an Alzheimer's 
victim that has eloped or wandered. No small feat — pun intended — to reduce the overwhelming 
stress on the millions of victim caregivers while potentially saving thousands from injuries and 
death owing to exposure, accidents and criminal activity. The GPS Shoe also reduces the 
manpower drain on municipal services; fire, police and welfare agencies often enlisted to locate 
the mentally ill. 
While a Finalist in the Most Innovative Location Device category of the Locations &amp; Beyond 
Summit and the People's Choice Awards is a wonderful acknowledgment for the years GTXO 
invested in developing the solution and the promise that Aetrex has made in bringing the Shoe to 
market... the real winners are those touched by this devastating disease for which there is no cure, 
but now have a new measure of hope.

who have Alzheimer's who wander and are at risk of getting lost or injured. A GPS device in one 
of the shoes will alert a caregiver if the wearer leaves a specified area. Don't expect the latest 
styles from Nike ( NKE - news - people ) or Steve Madden ( shoo - news - people ) . The

Keeping an eye on Mom and Dad 
Remote monitoring technology aims to keep seniors in their houses and out of nursing homes ____ 
Over the coming months a raft of new-and-improved remote monitoring devices will hit the _____ 
market, from GPS shoes that can track the whereabouts of wandering seniors to MedCottages, 
portable RV-like units equipped with motion and monitoring systems that allow seniors to 
maintain some independence from the backyard of their adult childrens' homes. 
"As we age, this is going to be a growing trend," says Laurie Orlov, a Florida-based expert on so-
called "aging-in-place technology" aimed at keeping seniors in their houses and out of nursing 
homes as long as possible. 
"We have to get past the fear and antagonism among the older people who need it the most. I don't 
think they're that technology-ready, but the boomers, who are their adult children, certainly are." 
Motion sensors strategically placed in the three-bedroom home where Howe has lived for 53 years 
feed information right to her daughter's laptop, detailing when she got out of bed (the Friday we 
chatted it was 9 a.m.), walked into the bathroom (9:15 a.m.) or hovered at the kitchen table where 
she keeps her pills (9:30 a.m.) 
Even her blood-pressure reading (165/76) is fed to her daughter's computer, along with her daily 
weigh-in tally, providing a detailed graph which she often takes to her doctor appointments. 
The only thing GrandCare can't tell Pierce, because her system doesn't include cameras, is if her 
mother actually swallowed her pills. 
Monitoring and in-home help technologies will be a $20 billion U.S. business in North America by 
2020, predicts Orlov, founder of Aging In Place Technology Watch. 
Already some baby boomers are able to remotely lock their parents' doors, track calls coming into 
their homes and even see who is ringing the doorbell, in many cases right from their smart phones. 
Systems such as QuietCare, WellAWARE, FineThanx and SimplyHome are already fixtures in 
some U.S. homes and seniors' communities, although Orlov estimates fewer than 10,000 units are 
in active use because the systems can be so costly. 
Next month, Paul Whyte, a Markham dealer of smart-home technology that allows ordinary 
electronics and appliances to communicate with each other, will unveil the GrandCare system at 
the Zoomer show in Toronto. 
"I call it the invisible caregiver," says Whyte of Cybernetics Systems Inc. "The minute I saw this 
system I thought, 'There's something that actually makes sense.' 
The key, of course, with all these technologies is that the senior be relatively able-bodied and 
sound of mind — most are of limited value if the senior is suffering from dementia, which is 
expected to become a major public health issue in the next few decades. 
But developers are also working hard on that challenging front. 
Sometime later this fall or next spring the first GPS-equipped shoe, the Aetrex Ambulator, will go 
on sale through www.gpsshoe.com orwww.foot.com. 
Originally designed for children by Los Angeles-based GTX Corp., the new shoes are expected to 
retail for about $250 U.S. They enable caregivers to track those afflicted with dementia or 
Alzheimer's thanks to GPS and cellular technology that will relay their whereabouts back to a 
monitoring centre. 
"Privacy may be a talking point, but it's not really an issue," says Patrick Bertagna, chairman and 
CEO of GTX Corp. 
MEDCottage creator Dupin expects concerns around privacy will fade quickly as families and 
health-care systems here and in the U.S. become overwhelmed by aging baby boomers — more 
than 76 million in the U.S., 10 million in Canada — who start hitting 65 next year. 
"I see remote monitoring becoming an integral part of health care as we all age," says Dupin. "One 
of the issues around aging in place is going to be making trade-offs. Privacy may be something we 
have to give up."

Tracking Deal 
A downtown L.A. company that creates GPS tracking applications for cell phones has

The deal could mean more than 40 million more downloads, which would translate to increased 
revenue, for GTX Corp.'s application, which is currently available for the iPhone, BlackBerry and 
Android phones, said GTX Chief Executive Patrick Bertagna. 
The LociMobile tracking applications send a GPS signal out to all of a person's cell phone 
contacts who use the app. Bertagna said the app can be used to meet up with friends or keep tabs 
on kids. 
GTX has also developed a GPS shoe for tracking Alzheimer's patients.

Kirk Johnson - NYTimes.com - May 4, 2010 - One Alzheimer's wanderer in Arizona had lost 
much of his memory, but not, apparently, his interest in fashion: he never left the house without a 
beloved baseball cap on his head. So a trick the family used to keep the man around was to hide 
his caps. 
Search-and-rescue experts who deal with dementia patients also recommend alarms on doors that 
sound when opened if a proper code is not entered, along with posters or wallpaper images that 
disguise or conceal doors. Sometimes a simple large, emphatic sign on every door saying "Stop!" 
will deter a wanderer.

New App craze brings back the 1990's 
World Market Media - April 9, 2010 - Every Portfolio manager I've 
ever known loves to find a sector with wind at it's back..the early 
users of the "CrackBerry" knew (Nasdaq: RIMM) was the stock 
he/she needed to invest in because every person on Wall Street had 
one. This phenomena doesn't occur often and RIMM"s are as rare as 
Australopithecus. I observe the current app craze as the new cycle for 
lightning quick revenues based on the size of the market itself. 
Certainly anyone with an iPhone or Android phone has imagined that 
they could build an app when they got home that night. .1 know I 
did. 
I can tell you from experience that when Kleiner Perkins doubles the size of its venture fund 
specific to app's you know your watching the ship turning in the harbor. This is a unique space 
with wind at it's back and certainly the app's market is a niche to watch, we found this company 
and had a chance to speak with Patrick Bertagna at GTX Corp (OTCBB:GTX0) its Founder/ 
Chairman and CEO. He had some interesting comments about how the company has evolved and 
found some traction with its wholly owned subsidiary LOCiMOBILE Inc. Bertagna commented 
"With 500 million smart phones entering the market place, I believe we are at the tip of the next 
disruptive wave. Apps will become as ubiquitous as the device they live on and that makes this 
new frontier a game changer" Certainly being on the iTunes top ten highest grossing list puts us at 
the forefront of this coming wave."

Kids Sneakers That Know Where They Are 
Castro Valley Forum - CA, USA - By : Michael Singer: 10/16/07 
There is a trend in high-tech that recommends adding location-based services to anything and 
everything. But it has me pulled between wanting to see really cool gadgets and avoiding a Big 
Brother-like society. 
The latest is a new high-tech tennis shoe coming to the market that lets parents and guardians track 
the movements of their family using Global Positioning Systems or GPS technology. 
Called the "Smart Shoe," the miniature device is inserted in the sole of the low-top sneaker. An 
antenna that runs up the back of the footwear communicates with satellites and relays a location 
back to a subscription Web site service for easy viewing. Los Angeles-based GTXC, which makes 
the devices and the service, said it is hoping to put Smart Shoes in stores by the end of the year. 
Shoes with the technology could cost between $100 and $200. The tracking service is expected to 
cost about $20 a month. 
Follow That Kid 
Today's technology makes it easier for parents to know where their kids are and what they're 
doing. 
By Joe Burris 1Baltimore Sun July 1, 2007 
Michelle Smith had been reluctant to buy a cell phone for her 7-year-old daughter, Daysha. Then 
one day in April, a substitute teacher placed the Radford, Va., girl on the wrong school bus. 
Instead of being dropped off at her older sister's after-school program as planned, Daysha was sent 
home - only to find the doors locked. 
As she sat on her front porch crying, her mother drove around town, searching frantically for the 
girl. No one at the school could tell her which bus the girl had been put on. 
"Then my next-door neighbor called," said Smith, "and said, 'I have your baby.'" 
The scary moment had a happy ending, but Smith didn't want to take a chance on losing her 
daughter again. So she did what many other parents are doing - she bought her child a cell phone 
equipped with an electronic device that could keep track of her whereabouts.

Mobile Ways to Keep Track of Your Kids 
By Lori Tucker, (WATE) Knoxville, TN -- June 7, 2007 
As technology makes our society more mobile, there are more mobile ways to keep track of your 
loved ones including cell phones, car trackers and even shoes. GPS shoes That's right, an LA 
company has patented a GPS system in a shoe. 
Xplorer Smart Shoes, made by GTX Corp., are able to track the person wearing them in real time 
or by remote surveillance. 
GTX says the shoes work particularly well for: children, people with Alzheimer's disease, outdoor 
adventures, military, police, fire and public safety workers. 
IN THE PIPELINE: Tracking All The Uses For Positioning Chips 
By Donna Fuscaldo - DowJones Newswire - May 1, 2007 
For Patrick Bertagna, the eureka moment came a few years ago when watching the coverage of the 
Elizabeth Smart abduction. After spending years helping companies track their products via 
software, Bertagna decided it was time to do something that mattered. 
So the serial entrepreneur, armed with a couple of checks from friends, launched Global Trek 
Xploration Corp., a Los Angeles-based company that's developing shoes embedded with a global 
positioning chip. The shoes will enable parents to monitor their children's every movement and 
caregivers to keep real time tabs on elderly or sick people.

Top-Notch Security 
M2M - Specialty Publications - April 6, 2007 
M2M technology providers and system integrators often cite efficiency improvements and new 
revenue opportunities as common indicators of return-on-investment. However, as more and more 
customers use machine-to-machine applications to collect data, security has not only become a 
top-notch priority for end users and OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) but also a highly 
valued part of fostering a positive ROI. 
According to IDC Corp., www.idc.com, Framingham, Mass., as devices enabling a mobile 
workforce continue to shrink in size, the increased likelihood of losing devices, such as laptops, 
mobile phones, BlackBerrys, has caused growing concern over the sensitive corporate information 
they contain. 
Smart Shoes Get Smarter 
M2M - Specialty Publications - April 2, 2007 
Smart shoes just got a little smarter. The newest models of GPS-enabled (global positioning 
system) shoes from Global Trek Xploration Corp. (GTXC), www.gtxcorp.com, Los Angeles, 
Calif., will now be equipped with wireless and location modules from Enfora 
Inc.,www.enfora.com, Plano, Texas. 
GTXC chose Enfora's Enabler IIG-A-GPS modules for its robust and accurate platform, company 
executive say. Eric Stalnaker vice president of business development at GTXC explains, "Enfora 
and the Enabler II provide us with an integrated approach to software, Internet connectivity, and 
customization that lets us focus on our product and service offering."

Few at conference get to soul of GPS shoe 
Satellite tracking services were expected to be one of the big attractions at this year's big wireless 
conference in Orlando, but the satellite shoe seemed to surprise most of the people walking around 
the convention floor. 
Many passers-by Wednesday furrowed their brows or shook their heads at what appeared to be a 
silly toy for spoiled yuppie joggers. Only a few investigated long enough to realize that the GPS 
shoe may well be one of the least frivolous prototypes on display among the 1,100 
exhibitors. Developers plan to sell the device as a way to track mentally disabled people or 
seniors who have Alzheimer's disease. 
Where would you be without GPS? 
Perhaps carrying fewer gadgets: The technology is being added to shoes, MP3 players, dogs 
By Carolyn Y. Johnson Boston Globe 1February 19, 2007 
This month, GTX Corp. launched a line of Xplorer Smart GPS shoes that transform sneakers into 
a wearable LoJack system. 
ABI Research found that the number of people in North America who subscribe to GPS-enabled 
location-based services more than doubled between 2005 and 2006, from 1.6 to 3.9 million. The 
number of subscribers is projected to rocket to 52 million in 2011. 
That means companies working in what used to be a niche market have been enjoying explosive 
growth. Revenues at TomTom NV, a Concord-based maker of personal navigation products, have 
increased more than 500-fold since 2001, from $2.5 million to an estimated $1.7 billion last 
year. Garmin's business has exploded into the mainstream, too, and the company ran its first 
Super Bowl ad this year. Boston-based start-up Skyhook Wireless brings location awareness to 
any device with WiFi, and announced a major partnership this month with GPS platform maker 
SiRF. 
Xplorer shoes offer advanced personal location services 
from Wearable Electronics 
January 29, 2007 - We've written several times about the concept of electronically fencing dogs

Integrated GPS Shoes by GTXC 
Getoutdoors.com Outdoor Blog - Friday, February 2. 2007 
Integrated GPS Shoes by GTXC Though originally made to track patients and kids, we're sure the 
shoes will be integrated soon with the Nike + Ipod so you can track your run in your personal 
Google mashup. Or hide it in your wife's purse to see whether she's banging San Francisco's 
mayor, Gavin Newsom. Or something like that. The system from GTXC has a sophisticated GPS 
integrated into the shoe, which communicates directly with a satellite, which then relays locations 
in real-time to their monitoring center and made available via intemet or phone. Predetermined 
geographic areas can also be defined and alerts sent when the person being tracked leaves or enters 
the area. And don't worry, they already have a product for outdoor activities called the Wearable 
Caddy. 
New Smart GPS Shoes 
Manisha Kanetkar - Thursday, 1 February 2007 
Keeping track of your loved ones has never been so easy (or so spy-like) with the new Xplorer 
smart GPS shoes designed by GTXC. 
The company boasts the shoes incorporate the smallest, most powerful and robust GPS tracking 
device currently available. GTXC says they are ideal for caretakers of children or the elderly to 
easily monitor the location of their charges. 
So, for example, they can preset perimeters of safe zones or unsafe zones, and then receive mobile 
phone alerts if a perimeter is breached by the wearer. This is handled by what the company calls 
its 'set-it-and-forget-it' Dual GeoFencing feature.

Jeffrey, 
this may be a long shot to save the Boeing deal, or if you think its a dead deal, disregard this. 
I thought there was a connection between Tarek and myself, I do believe one concern was operation of Boeing with 
flight crew. I know its his problem not ours, but may help make the sale happen,. 
I wrote this email for your review, if you think its worth sending, please critique, and let me know,. thank you: 
Mr. Tarek El Sayed, 
I hope this email finds you well, and believe worth communicating my thoughts to you. 
I was surprised to hear that you decided against the purchase of our Super Boeing 727. I personally thought it was a great match for 
your business needs in Qatar. If for any reason your decision was based on crew issues and charter needs in the Middle East, I'd like 
to share some information that might prove beneficial to making you reconsider this purchase. 
The pilot candidates I have lined up for your interview along with the possibility of David Rodgers joining your flight department 
were as follows: 
(at no time did I disclose location or persons to the following pilot candidates to protect your privacy.) 
Robert Breslin, who is the former Chief Pilot of Mr. Donald Trump, Mr. Breslin flew the Boeing 727 and Boeing 757 owned by Mr 
Trump. Mr Breslin is a fine man of 40 years of age estimate, with extensive VIP Boeing operations. 
James Bartakowski, who has extensive flying experience in the Middle east, Africa and Europe regime. Mr. Bartakowski has also 
been involved in charter operations in Africa and Middle East and has contacted me on several recent occasions with charters for 
our Boeing 727, James has indicated there is the possibility of 40 — 60 hours per month charter operations for larger transport 
category aircraft in your area. I believe there is a growing need for charter in the business community in Qatar and neighboring 
countries. 
Bruce Jafahri, who is a current Boeing 727 captain who lived in Doha for two years, and familiar with international operations of 
Boeing 727 aircraft. Mr. Jafahri currently lives in California and ready for a new opportunity. Bruce is current in the Boeing 727 and 
also flew Captain on the Boeing 747. Well qualified individual and personable. 
Mr. El Sayed, as you have seen during our demo flight, our Boeing 727 is in impeccable condition, quite cabin and will provide many 
years of charter and business flights your company. I believe the large business jet future in Qatar is growing and you will be leading 
its path, and your initial investment in this purchase will not come close with other aircraft options on the market as you may have 
seen already. 
We are currently completing the C2C check on the Boeing, and as we have done in the past, assure you it will be a fine aircraft 
when it leaves Flight Star Maintenance repair facility. 
Sincerely, 
Lawrance Visoski

I spoke to my FAA in Orlando, it will take the buyer 6 months to obtain a FAR125 certificate if we do not include ours, 
Darren and Rich are working on possibility of including JEGE, INC with sale of Boeing, this will be valuable to buyer and 
prove to be beneficial monetarily to you if we can include the company name in the sale. FAA informs me its taken 
under into consideration on a case by case basis if they will approve another buyer to operate my FAR125 certificate. My 
FAA inspector did mention that Trump did the same deal when he purchased his B757, it included the manuals and 
company.

-Counter the offer at $2.750M

transition and keeps the B727 on its current FAR125, tremendous value to buyer,. 
-Buyer understands purchase is "As Is" but has the opportunity to visually inspect the aircraft in Palm Bch along with my 
records. 
-closing to be on December 30th 2013. 
-Buyer will pay round trip repositioning expense Brunswick GA to Palm Beach and return to Brunswick if buyer declines 
the aircraft (fuel cost round trip $14,930.00). 
-Seller will deduct the reposition expense if buyer proceeds with purchase. (fuel expense to fly B727 to Palm Beach is

Why Palm Beach, Florida Is The 
'New Greenwich' For Wall Streeters 
R 
JACQUELINE DETWILER, DUJOUR

The Palm Beach finance crowd can paddleboard whenever they please. 
Behind a semicircular brick drive and a lawn as manicured as a putting 
green sits a 30,000-square-foot masterpiece of Italian Renaissance 
architecture called Casa Nana. 
John Porter, a real estate associate for Corcoran who oversees some of the 
largest sales in Palm Beach County, Florida, points out the spiral staircase, 
built by famed 19205 architect Addison Mizner for the founder of the 
National Tea Company. "This home went for $30.2 million in 2003; today 
that sum wouldn't be in the top 25 highest prices" of houses for sale in this 
area, Porter says. "Palm Beach real estate has gone from nothing going on to 
nothing left to sell." 
Porter is giving me a tour of the so-called Billionaire's Row, a stretch of 
South Ocean Boulevard on the island of Palm Beach that is bordered by 
some of the highest hedges I've ever seen. Through gaps in the greenery 
appear stone fountains, elephant statues, pools the size of tennis complexes 
(next to actual tennis complexes), and more clay roofs than one could count. 
It's a monumental display of wealth, and it is rapidly expanding, not just 
here but in Delray Beach, Jupiter, Palm Beach Gardens and Boca Raton, as 
money pours out of the Northeast (and in some cases, from as far as London 
and Singapore) and into this already wealthy section of southeast Florida. 
Approximately 70 hedge and private equity funds are now headquartered 
here, many of which have set up shop in the last two years, jacking up home 
prices and spurring a countywide initiative to become, as some have said, 
"the new Greenwich." 
For hedge fund managers who might normally be inclined toward 
Westchester or Connecticut, the allure of South Florida is as plain as grits 
on toast. The homes are sprawling; the Intracoastal Waterway is a yachter's 
paradise. It has a glittering social scene. During high season—October 
through March—there might be several fundraisers on any given night. 
Perhaps the key factor, however: In Florida, there are no individual income 
taxes, no estate taxes and no capital gains taxes. A hedge fund manager 
reporting $1 million in income can expect to pay only the federal 
government, whereas his counterpart living in Connecticut pays that plus an 
extra $67,000. And if the poor schmuck were still in New York City? He'd 
better be ready to fork over $104,300. 
As for why all of this is happening now, when Florida has long been a sunny 
tax haven, so to speak, financiers point to the upcoming application of 
Section 457A of the Internal Revenue Code. Before 457A was enacted, 
certain fees and related earnings could grow tax deferred in offshore 
accounts for up to ten years. But now, according to the section, hedge fund 
managers will need to funnel all of the fees that were deferred before 2009 
and their related earnings back into the U.S. by 2017. If a manager lives in 
Florida when this happens, he's much less likely to pay exorbitant state 
taxes on the whole amount. If he still lived in New York City? 
Fuggedaboudit. 
It's the job of Kelly Smallridge, president and CEO of the Palm Beach 
Business Development Board, to ensure that hedge fund and private equity 
managers are informed of these benefits, in the hopes that they, and their 
firms, will become Palm Beach County's newest residents. She's developed a 
red-carpet tour that goes beyond looking at office space and real estate to 
include meeting headmasters at private schools, the school-district 
superintendent and the mayor and speaking with the governor's staff and 
CEOs who have moved their operations here. Plus, of course, a few nights 
on the town. 
In the winter, when the well-to-do from all over the Northeast visit Florida 
for charity balls, the board hosts dinners and parties for prospective 
relocators and local captains of industry. Last year, Smallridge and 
company sponsored a soiree aboard a $70 million yacht that featured Veuve 
Clicquot, caviar and live jazz. Guests—who included the CEOs of a national 
IT company, a major finance company and a land developer, venture 
capitalists, hedge fund managers and the creator of Goldman Sachs' prime 
brokerage division—took private tours with the captain of the yacht. 
Smallridge is also working with former hedge fund CIO Dr. Rainford Knight 
to develop a club for local investment managers called SocialAlpha that 
encourages bankers in Palm Beach County's ritzy social scene to get to know 
each other. Even Florida governor Rick Scott has gotten involved, sending 
personal letters to friends and prospects from the Northeast (the governor is 
a former Greenwich resident and businessman) to convince them of 
Florida's merits. 
Smallridge and Governor Scott are hoping to induce a snowball effect, and 
so far, it seems to be working. Every financier who moves south chips away 
at the primary reason to remain near New York City—the fact that everyone 
else is there. That's not to say it's been easy. Florida is still Florida, and 
popular opinion has not been kind. Even Palm Beach, which has for the 
most part dodged the insults hurled at the rest of the state, is known for its 
residents' apocalyptically bad driving and worse Hawaiian shirts. 
"There was a fair amount of trepidation," says Al Rabil III, managing 
partner and CEO of Kayne Anderson Real Estate Advisors, who made the 
move from Armonk, New York, with 20 coworkers this summer. "But once 
everybody got past the stereotypes and actually came and looked, that 
changed." He says most of his employees weren't looking for bottle service 
and models anyway. The majority of those who have reached the upper 
echelons of financial management are married with children, and the appeal 
of a semi-tropical paradise with luxury restaurants, year-round recreation, 
and sophisticated socializing in a community far more tight-knit than 
Manhattan (yes, that'sDonald Trump over there) is not lost on them. 
Porter's tour of Billionaire's Row was part of a modified version of one of 
the Business Development Board's red-carpet tours that I took as part of 
researching this story. I ate breakfast at the clubby Top of the Point 
restaurant with some of the area's prominent financiers. A waiter in a 
captain's outfit served lobster rolls while a CPA, a lawyer and the executive 
director of the Palm Beach County Education Commission touted the area's 
benefits. I surveyed real estate and office space surrounded by miles of 
water without once having my foot stepped on by a tourist. You can see how 
all this might sway someone who's on the fence. 
Exploring the sugary beaches of South Florida, one starts to wonder why 
Wall Streeters would be on the fence at all. Between the smiling locals and 
the shopping on Worth Avenue, the Hiaasen-esque stereotypes recede. 
What remains are the facts: Take-home pay is higher, commutes are 
shorter, and it's just as fabulous as Manhattan, at least for four months of 
the year. Meanwhile, no one in Florida even owns an ice scraper. With the 
Internet allowing more and more money managers to perform their work 
from nearly anywhere, there are few reasons not to make the move. 
"Initially, it was a way to play golf and keep the wife and kids happy," says 
Brett Langbert, managing director and head of sales at I.A. Englander &amp; Co. 
"But once we moved down, it became a quality-of-life issue. There are 
unlimited things the kids can do outside. I have to tell you, my wife and I 
are so happy we haven't had to go to one of those indoor bouncy-castle 
places since we got here."

Commission touted the area's benefits. I surveyed real estate and office space surrounded by miles of 
water without once having my foot stepped on by a tourist. You can see how all this might sway someone 
who's on the fence. 
Exploring the sugary beaches of South Florida, one starts to wonder why Wall Streeters would be on the 
fence at all. Between the smiling locals and the shopping on Worth Avenue, the Hiaasen-esque stereotypes 
recede. What remains are the facts: Take-home pay is higher, commutes are shorter, and it's just as 
fabulous as Manhattan, at least for four months of the year. Meanwhile, no one in Florida even owns an 
ice scraper. With the Internet allowing more and more money managers to perform their work from nearly 
anywhere, there are few reasons not to make the move. 
"Initially, it was a way to play golf and keep the wife and kids happy," says Brett Langbert, managing 
director and head of sales at I.A. Englander &amp; Co. "But once we moved down, it became a quality-of-life 
issue. There are unlimited things the kids can do outside. I have to tell you, my wife and I are so happy 
we haven't had to go to one of those indoor bouncy-castle places since we got here."

Subject: Re: 
begining edits 
David Ben Gurion was asked why he, after 2000 
years, in contrast to the many great leaders in 
the past was uniquely able to re -established the 
State of Israel. BG responded that he thought that 
it must have been true that in ancient times people 
had been born with a sixth sense. The one 
enabling individuals to have the ability 
to recognize and the seize opportunities. Though 
few of those individuals remain I think I am one of 
the fortunate few. He didn't mentioned the horrors 
or the sacrifice of the 48' war. I believe 
Menachem Begin had it,as several years after the 
bitter 73' war he was able to make a daring 
peace with Egypt. Als lzhak Rabin,who now 20yrs 
ago, signed the Peace treaty with Jordan though 
in amidst a wave of terror. He faced huge internal 
rejection but it began the first baby steps towards 
a settlement with the Palestinians. As we all know 
he was assassinated by a Jewish terrorist. These 
leaders all faced many risks, yet were able to see 
and seize an opportunity. Statesmanship and 
leadership.. 
During the last three years we have been living 
through a geo political earthquake. The world 
order, which existed since the demise of the 
Ottoman Empire, is collapsing.The Arab Spring 
appears to have turned into an Islamist Winter. 
Borders are erased. Old tribal and sectarian 
disputes have awakened. In perfect storm like 
fashion Israel now finds itself surrounded by 
clashes of civilizations, in addition to the Islam 
confrontation between fanatic terror and moderna, 
Suna and Shia, the legacy threats: Iran, Assad in 
Syria, Hezbullah in Lebanon,Hamas in Gaza are 
all still active and worrying. 
we have to be alert and ready to strongly respond 
to any threat to our security.. 
But I believe new opportunities are there for the 
taking. This opportunity,which might not occur 
again for generations ,is the potential to reshape 
our relationships with the Arab Moderates based 
on our common concerns. Extremism, Terror and 
Iran. This could open the gate to a more peaceful 
Middle East based on cooperation and synergies 
rather than blood and revenge. However thers is, 
in my opnion n o way to achieve but to move 
forward with the Palestinians 
A precondition to seize such an opportunity is a 
mighty, sober, self confident Israel, in strong 
alliance with the US. An Israel which can deter or 
defeat any combination of regional powers, yet, an 
Israel who is ready to contemplate and consider a 
modified Saudi or Arab League Plan as a basis for 
negotiations. 
The unique relationship we have developed with 
the US over the last 45yrs based on common 
values ,mutual respect and shared interests is a 
cornerstone of our strength, world posture and 
our future. It is also a crucial building block of any 
regional peace and cooperation strategy.Allowing 
IL/US relations to remain damaged, I believe is a 
grave mistake with potentially far reaching 
consequences. 
As the Minister of Defense of Israel I've met more 
than once with President Obama , as well as with 
President Bush before him„ reiterating with both 
that the though the US is clearly our best friend 
and ally, Israel is a Sovereign state and when our 
security and the future of Israel and the Jewish 
people are at stake we might need to take 
tough decisions on our own. We cannot and will 
not, I added, delegate the responsibility for such 
decisions to even our best friends ,. We respect 
the fact that we might have different views. 
American Presidents have always understood that 
. We also must have the same respect when the 
US decides it is its interest to take decisions we 
might not fully agree with. 
this relation is of course not fully symmetric. It is 
the US which will provides Israel with the new F-
35s and ensures the Qualitative Edge of the IDF 
vis a vis any combination of neighbors. It is the 
US who significantly financed the Iron Dome, 
Arrow and David's Sling missile defense systems. 
It is the US that has commited to defend Israel in 
the event of a missile attack from Iran. 
We should never forget it. 
The recent spurt of verbal exchanges is a 
worrying signal that something has gone wrong. It 
needs corrrection.. Netanyahu is not a coward. 
I've seen him as a young special forces 
officer ,under my command, facing fire directly and 
taking risks to his life. A very courageous soldier. 
That will never change. cheap words serve little 
purpose .The same applies to President Obama 
and Secretary Kerry. they are not enemies of 
Israel. they are Good Friends. Kerry has exhibited 
decades long support for Israel. Since he became 
Secretary of State he has invested his time 
energy and prestige trying to help Israel and the 
Palestinians to bridge disputes and reach a 
breakthrough. it was a noble effort which 
should justify thanks rather than accustations. We 
are of course concerned by the lack of outcome of 
the P5+1 negotiations with Iran and we think that 
the chemical weapons removal from Syria could 
have been handled differently But President 
Obama strengthens the legacy of Presidential 
support for Israel.. Israel has a vital interest in 
resuming the healthy trust, and mutual respect 
that existed until recently. 
. I believe that the most profound internal debate 
inside Israel today is in regard to the relationship 
between Israel's security needs and the viability of 
the "two states solution". We all agree that we are 
living in a tough, merciless and highly 
unpredictable neighborhood..So it is clear that our 
security needs are of the highest priority and we 
should build certain "safety margins" into any 
future security planning.But the Israeli Right is 
going too far by arguing that the security needs of 
Israel renders any viable,demilitarized 
independent, Palestinian State - impossible. 
In other words, the " lesson" of recent years 
according to our Right is that Israel's Security and 
the "two states solution" are incompatible. I believe 
this is a fallacious conclusion, driven by narrow 
political interests. 
I've served a lifetime career, fighting and 
defending my country's security. Most of the time 
in uniform. Based on this experience ,I confidently 
conclude,and it is a professional rather than 
political answer, that if and when a Palestinian 
demilitarized independent State will be established 
side by side with Israel behind borders which will 
consist of a solid Jewish majority for generations 
to come and will include the major "Settlement 
Blocks" accompanied by mutually agreed swaps 
and an Israeli long term military presence along 
the River Jordan - the IDF and the 
SecurityServices will be capable 
of defending Israel. Moreover, I'm confident that 
if we will bring together all former Israeli Chiefs of 
Staff, all former Commanders of the Central 
Command( responsible for Judea and Samaria) 
and all former Heads of Intelligence ,SecServices 
and Mossad, an extremely vast majority of them 
will agree with me on this issue. True,it might take 
time, frustrations and setbacks. It might have to go 
through prolonged periods of interim 
arrangements. but the IDF is much superior to any 
conceivable rival and will be able to defend Israel 
under all those circumstances. 
the Right argument is convoluted, the opposite is 
true. The real big threat to the Zionist Project is not 
the "two state solution" but rather the "one state 
solution" which will lead inevitably to either a non 
Jewish or a non democratic, potentially ever 
bleeding State. Still,this is the vision the Israeli 
extreme Right shares unknowingly with the Hamas 
(and with all due differences with the lunatic, Post 
Zionist fringes of the Israeli Left). 
In order to seize the opportunity for regional peace 
and cooperation arrangements and in order to 
block the deterioration towards "one state solution" 
action, tenacity and decisiveness will be essential. 
politics of survival, anxiety and pessimism will not 
do. 
we are facing a moment of truth. a time for daring 
decisions.The essence of Zionism, its raison d'être 
had always been to take our fate in our hands. 
make decisions and follow them with actions, 
rather than being dragged by events and decisions 
of others and paying the price for it. 
our legendary Foreign Minister Abba Eban 
famously said that the Palestinians had never 
missed an opportunity to miss an opportunity. Lets 
not fall into the same trap.

Tonja--
The National ENQUIRER is preparing to publish a story that Bill Clinton used a private "orgy" jet to travel to 
Brunei for an extraordinary dinner with a royal accused of duping American women into "white slavery." 
The ENQUIRER will report that Bill was accompanied by the 727's owner, billionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, 
when he landed in the tiny South-East Asian country on May 25, 2002. His entourage also included two 
women who allegedly worked as "madams" for Epstein, luring teenaged girls into sex trysts with the tycoon 
and his powerful and famous friends. 
According to The ENQUIRER's investigation, Bill spent the day playing golf at a seven-star hotel -- and then was 
invited to dine with Brunei's sultan, Hassanal Bolkiah .....who was charged with holding a deeply-religious 
Christian beauty queen as a "human chattel." Far from being embarrassed by the ruler's tawdry 
reputation, moreover, records for Bill's nonprofit foundation reveal that Brunei made a donation towards his 
Clinton Presidential Library that year of between $1. million and $5 million. 
Please kindly attempt to provide any comment by 4 pm ET tomorrow, Friday January 30th to Lachlan 
Cartwright, Executive Editor, at [Office] or

I wish I had a reason to go to Paris this weekend. I am headed to LA now for two events and meetings. Back 
late Friday. I am thrilled we got my money. I loved the lawyer Martin telling me I deserved more. Made me 
hate my idiot brother even more. We are ahead of billing from last year and it's the quiet time. Will stay in 
touch. How are you doing. Has all that vile publicity finally gone away for good or do the keep stirring the

Going up to NY Friday morning. Think I am going to drive. I will then stop to pee and get gas at a rest stop on 
the New Jersey turnpike, will observe all of the people there who are at least 100 pounds overweight, will have 
a mild panic attack as a result of the observation, and will then decide that I am not eating another bite of food 
for the rest of my life out of fear that I will end up like one of these people.

Fareed Zakaria: Trump sells America short 
Dear Donald Trump: China, Japan and Mexico are not "killing us" 
By Fareed Zakaria, Thursday, September 17, 2015 
Donald Trump's presidential bid is centered on the promise of his personal talents. He says he's the "most successful 
person ever to run for the presidency, by far." (George Washington and Dwight Eisenhower, sit down!) But if there is an 
idea animating his candidacy, it is that the United States is being badly beaten by its economic competitors. In his speech 
on foreign policy this week, Trump explained that America is being bested by countries such as China, Japan and Mexico 
because their leaders are "smarter, more cunning and sharper than our leaders." "They're killing us," he often says. 
This is an odd moment to make these charges because the reality is almost entirely the opposite. The United States is 
more dominant on the global economic landscape than at any point since the heyday of Bill Clinton's presidency — 
perhaps even more so. 
Last quarter, the U.S. economy grew at a 3.7 percent clip. Annual growth now is almost twice that of Europe and four 
times that of Japan. Unemployment is at 5.1 percent, the lowest in seven years. The deficit as a percentage of gross 
domestic product (2.8 percent in 2014) is at its lowest since 2007. 
"The U.S. has come out of the 2008 crisis better than all the others," says Ruchir Sharma, head of global macro investing 
at Morgan Stanley. "Americans have reduced their debt burden more than the Europeans, while China's debt has 
skyrocketed to extremely dangerous levels. If you look outside of China, U.S. growth is actually faster even than the 
emerging markets. Since the 2008 crisis, U.S. equity markets have outperformed all others — in fact 9 out of the 10 most 
valuable companies in the world are now American. The dollar is the currency of choice. Global growth is not what it 
used to be, but in a bad neighborhood, the U.S. has the best house by far." Sharma points out that for the past four 
years, the United States' share of global GDP has increased while Europe's and Japan's have moved down. 
When I was in Europe last week, businessmen there were concerned with what they saw as a new level of U.S. 
dominance in everything from technology to entertainment to finance. Consider America's big banks. They were at the 
epicenter of the financial crisis and were badly battered by it. Since then, bankers have complained that they've faced 
uncertainty about government policies, overzealous regulators trying to compensate for their laxness before the crisis 
and the unwieldy burdens of the Dodd-Frank law. 
Well, U.S. banks today are more dominant than ever. The Wall Street Journal notes that in the past five years, JPMorgan 
Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have increased in value by $254.6 billion. In the 
same period, their European competitors, Barclays, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, UBS and Royal Bank of Scotland added 
just $9.5 billion. In July, Barclays Chairman John McFarlane was asked if America's banks were eating European lenders' 
lunch. He replied: "They are doing a good job of it." He added that the U.S. banks "are the only ones that really claim to 
be global and successful." 
To compare the United States' performance and leadership to Mexico's, Japan's and China's is particularly ill-timed. 
Trump might be stuck in a 1980s time warp on Japan. When his "The Art of the Deal" was published in 1987, Americans 
were envious of Japan's brilliant leaders, who were said to be outsmarting the United States at every turn. Since then, 
Japan has become the poster child for economic stagnation and political paralysis. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has been 
unwilling or unable to get his promised reforms enacted, and the country's economy continues to shrink. 
Mexico is watching its growth collapse. While its president, Enrique Pena Nieto, is a courageous and intelligent leader 
who has made some very bold decisions, he has also made some significant missteps. Most important, the country was 
ill-prepared for plunging oil prices that have battered government revenues and growth. 
China has had three decades of supercharged growth and competent government policy. But in the past few years, 
Beijing went on a borrowing binge, running up its total debt to levels that are unprecedented, according to Sharma. And 
in the past two months it has made mistakes in managing both its equity markets and currency — mistakes that have 
cost $400 billion, the Financial Times reports. 
Of course, the United States has problems that are worrying, such as wage stagnation and low labor-force participation. 
But the important comparison is not to some ideal fantasy of what America might be but to other countries in the real 
world. And the facts show, Mr. Trump, we're killing them.

I think you should let him hang himself If he says he hasn't been on the plane or to the house, then that gives 
you a valuable PR and political currency. You can hang him in a way that potentially generates a positive 
benefit for you, or, if it really looks like he could win, you could save him, generating a debt. Of course, it is 
possible that, when asked, he'll say Jeffrey is a great guy and has gotten a raw deal and is a victim of political 
correctness, which is to be outlawed in a Trump regime. 
if we were able to craft an answer for him, what do you think it should be?

Mr. Weinberg — 
I am a reporter with the ABC News investigative unit. We are gathering background research on the major candidates 
for President. 
Seeing that both former President Clinton and Mr. Trump have been mentioned in connection to the Jeffrey Epstein 
case, I am interested in better understanding the case, it's current status, and any information that could help explain 
Mr. Epstein's dealings and interactions with both men. 
I would very much appreciate the chance to meet and discuss this subject in an off the record conversation at your 
earliest convenience. 
Please let me know if that would be possible, and if so, when and where we could meet.

ABC doesn't really have an "investigative unit" so unless you want to hand it to them they won't pursue, so 
ignore. But, nevertheless, the more Trump looks real, or perish the thought, inevitable, the more reporters are 
going to focus on this, so, as you will not be surprised, you need a strategy.

A pal from Trump's military school days came out in his defense. What the author failed to mention 
was Peter Ticktin's law license has been suspended twice since 2009 for unethical practice of law. 
Makes him the perfect "character witness" for The Donald, eh?

A few things to think about: 
If the Patterson book is being published in August, that presents some time frame issues. You would not be able 
to do a competing book or documentary before then. This is not to say that they shouldn't be pursued. In a 
sense, better that they know what Patterson's position is and, a year from now say, be able to counter it. I have 
some thoughts on book and doc to share at your convenience. 
That being said, you do need an immediate counter narrative to the book. I believe Trump offers an ideal 
opportunity. It's a chance to make the story about something other than you, while, at the same time, letting you 
frame your own story. Also, becoming an anti-Trump voice gives you a certain political cover which you 
decidedly don't have now. Still, this necessary involves you going public. And so the most basic decision is 
about your willingness to do that. My view is that in a couple of weeks you could master message and technical 
proficiency. I know a bunch of people who could be very helpful here. This would involve something along the 
lines of you writing an op-ed, doing a high profile television interview (Charlie Rose, I'd say), and perhaps 
some social media efforts. 
Speaking of which, again, I think a strategic plan, involving your public identity, philanthropic activities and 
interests, and the development of media allies, ought finally to be put in place. A big, comprehensive, expensive 
effort. 
The alternative is to continue to keep head down and hope Patterson book is just more he-said she-said and 
Connolly getting lost in the reeds (which, as an inveterate conspiracist, he always does). My worry is that 
Patterson can be counted on to produce a bestseller, and while he isn't regarded as a serious writer, he'll surely 
be unloading a lot of tabloid copy. Because this will be tied to the election, the Trump-Clinton angle will amp 
up the attention 10-fold, in fact, possibly, a hundred fold. Possibly more than anything you've encountered 
before. 
Meanwhile--
In a lawyer's letter, I'd suggest including the following points--not necessarily legal, but a warning about how a 
press campaign might unfold (publishers are more worried about being caught in negative media controversy 
than they are of legal threats): 
1) Little, Brown has made on the record representations to at least one well-known journalist that it was not 
publishing a book by James Patterson about Jeffrey Epstein--possibly an effort to avoid inquiries about the 
questionable nature of the book; 
2) The actual author of the book, John Connolly, is someone other than the stated author, James Patterson. 
Connolly is known to have developed an obsession with Epstein, such that, his longtime employer, Vanity Fair, 
has refused to allow him to write about Epstein for the magazine; 
3) Sources have confirmed for us that Patterson has had little more than a minimal consulting role in the book, 
and that Connolly has functioned in every material way as the book's researcher and writer. We believe 
Patterson's "authorship" of the book will not stand up to scrutiny. And, indeed, that the entire notion of an 
extension of the Patterson franchise into nonfiction, as it has been used in fiction and children's book--
effectively other authors writing under the Patterson name—presents a host of journalism ethical issues.

Mr. Weinberg 
I was referred to you by Alan Dershowitz, who told me you're Jeffrey Epstein's attorney. 
If this is the case, I was hoping to reach him through you to see if he'd be willing to speak on the record about 
his ties - or previous ties - to both the Clintons and Donald Trump? 
Would you be able to arrange a call or email exchange this week? 
Thanks for your consideration.

Importance: High 
My Extraordinarily Talented, Outrageous Friend, 
Thank you for asking how I am doing. The short answer is very well. I hope that you are in good health and 
continue to use your special talents to make the world a better place and for your somewhat unique 
amusements. 
The longer answer to your question is that at the end of 2014 I closed down the office of Landmark, transferred 
all of the assets to pay all of the major creditors, except me, and found myself as broke as I was when you first 
called me that Friday after Thanksgiving, with my only remaining assets, a large capital loss, my reputation, and 
my energy. 
Since then, our luck has been better than even an optimist like me would expect. Being free of the $500,000 a 
day I was fined by the OTS, after several years they abandoned this fine, which was initiated strictly to ensure 
that I had no opportunity to finance any new developments, I became involved with an extraordinary, large, 
important real estate development in Oklahoma City and two others in the D.C. area. 
The bad news is that my dear friend and good partner, Aubrey McClendon, was killed in a single car accident 
on March 2nd of this year and the development with great potential is now either delayed or abandoned. The 
good news is that our involvement in a 1,000 acre development on Deep Creek Lake in western Maryland is in 
the process of being financed and should be underway sometime this summer. Our second project is a 405 acre 
development in Harper's Ferry, West Virginia, that is probably the prettiest piece of property I know of in the 
U.S. that is zoned and developable. Its business plan is now underway and we should be in the financing mode 
this fall. My impression is that there is a tremendous amount of money on the sidelines, but the top 5% or 10% 
that control it are terribly frightened of losing money they don't need, while the 90% to 95% of the citizens are 
continuing their daily labors somewhat frightened that they are not certain where next month's or next year's 
mortgage payment is coming from. 
On a lighter note, Donald Trump recently bought our development in Ireland, Doonbeg Golf Club. It has been 
rated the first or second best resort in Europe. To-date, to my surprise, he is managing it reasonably well, 
probably because he is presently devoted to an endeavor that amuses him. 
Jeffrey, I want you to understand that I am extremely pleased and not at all melancholy about my present 
circumstances. Whenever I get an opportunity, I always visit those assets I helped create and almost without 
exception, I wish I had been smarter, but generally satisfied that I made a positive contribution and one much 
higher than normally done by my competitors, because I am fortunate that the labor focus of my life has not 
attracted the best and the brightest. 
When good fortune brings you to the D.C. area, please let me know. I always enjoy understanding your 
activities and do so with amazement and amusement. 
Jerry

In spite of outward appearances, I know very few know how you really feel and I can only hope that that 
feeling is shown best in the naming of your airplane.

Keep getting calls from that guy doing a book on you -- John Connolly. He seems very interested in 
your relationship with the news media. I told him you were a hell of a guy:) One oddity: he said he had 
been told that that quote from Trump about you in the original NY Mag story had been manufactured. 
ie, that I did not actually speak to Donald. Which is bull shit of course. I am sure that is what Trump 
told him as they have been getting a lot of questions from reporters about you. 
He actually seemed to be a sensible guy/solid reporter -- just from the few conversations I had with

Donald Trump says he has foreign policy experience because he ran the Miss Universe pageant in Russia 
Clinton attacks Trump's foreign policy as 'dangerously incoherent' 1 / 27U.S. Democratic presidential candidate 
Hillary Clinton lambasted Donald Trump's foreign policy platform as "dangerously incoherent" in a speech on 
Thursday that cast her Republican rival as both a dangerous and laughable figure. 
A former U.S. secretary of state, Clinton attacked Trump for his policies and his character, suggesting Trump 
might start a nuclear war if elected to the White House simply because "someone got under his very thin skin." 
"Donald Trump's ideas are not just different, they are dangerously incoherent," she said to a room of supporters 
in San Diego, California. "They're not even really ideas, just a series of bizarre rants, personal feuds and 
outright lies." 
____0 Mike Blake U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton delivers a speech on national 
security in San Diego, California, United States June 2, 2016. 
Clinton, the front-runner in the race to become the Democratic presidential nominee, delivered her speech as 
she seeks to shift her attention to the Nov. 8 election against likely rival Trump and away from Bernie Sanders, 
a U.S. senator from Vermont, who is continuing his longshot bid for the nomination. 
Trump, the Republicans' presumptive nominee, has said he would sit down with North Korean leader Kim Jong 
Un to try to stop Pyongyang's nuclear program and has criticized the decades-old NATO alliance with mainly 
European nations as obsolete and too costly for the United States. 
Clinton derided these and other positions, promising she would do a better job keeping the United States safe 
and standing in front of a backdrop of 19 large U.S. flags, an unusual abundance even by the standards of 
presidential campaign events. 
Trump, a billionaire businessman who has never held elected office or worked in government before, says he 
has experience dealing with foreign governments through setting up hotels, resorts, golf courses and beauty 
pageants in foreign countries. Clinton, who is also a former U.S. senator and former first lady, mocked this. 
"He says he has foreign policy experience because he ran the Miss Universe pageant in Russia," she said to loud 
laughter. 
Trump has talked tough on foreign policy. He has said he would bring back waterboarding and other brutal 
interrogation techniques for terrorism suspects that are widely regarded as torture and were discontinued by 
Democratic President Barack Obama. 
He has also vowed to renegotiate trade deals, called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country, and 
said he would ask members of the 28-nation NATO alliance to "pay up" or "get out." 
Trump has criticized Clinton for her handling of foreign policy during her 2009-2013 stint as foreign secretary, 
including the Sept. 11, 2012, attack by Islamist militants on a U.S. diplomatic facility in Benghazi, Libya, that 
killed the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans. 
He cites Clinton's support for the Iraq war - launched by former Republican President George W. Bush - as 
another example of her shortcomings. 
At a rally Wednesday night in Sacramento, California, Trump said he had seen a copy of Clinton's speech and 
"it was such lies about my foreign policy."

Chart of the Day - Economy and Society 
June 27, 2016 
Dear Barry, 
When it comes to describing Donald Trump's private jet, the word 
"impressive" would be an understatement. The presumptive Republican Party 
nominee bought the Boeing 757-200 from Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen 
and he spared no expense kitting it out. Dubbed "Trump Force One," the 
luxurious jet is equipped with a shower, gold-plated seatbelt buckles and a 
52-inch flatscreen with a library of 1,000 movies. Built in 1991, the 757 is 
estimated to have cost approximately $100 million. If Trump reaches the 
White House in November, he'll have to exchange his personal jet for the 
presidential fleet, two highly modified Boeing 747-200Bs. The aircraft used by 
the president were built in 1986 and operate with the Air Force One callsign 
when the president is onboard. Will switching jets prove one of Trump's few 
regrets if he becomes president? 
Even though it cannot boast gold-plated accessories, Air Force One is a 
larger aircraft, seating 70 passengers in comfort compared to Trump Force 
..11141, 
One's 43. The presidential jet is also slightly faster with a range of about 
6,800 nautical miles compared to 4,100 for a 757. A VC-25A can also be 
refuelled in mid-air by a tanker, extending its range even further. 
The two presidential planes cost $325 million each and their cost of operation 
comes to $179,750 per hour. The hourly cost of operation for a standard 757 
is just over $8,000 by comparison, though the taxpayer will pick up the higher 
bill for Air Force One. All that bling certainly inflated the cost of Trump Force 
One but Air Force One is expensive because it's packed with equipment and 
facilities to keep the president and his or her entourage safe at all times. 
There is a hospital onboard, electronic countermeasures and heavy shielding 
to afford protection in the event of an electromagnetic pulse during a nuclear 
attack. All in all, if Trump does end up travelling regularly on Air Force One, 
he probably won't regret trading in his gold seatbelt buckle for the presidential 
suite on one of the most sophisticated airliners in the world.

We have processed 943,338 tweets since the start of the presidential debate till now. 
Clinton's popularity has increased dramatically since the debate. According to our recent data, 62% support 
Clinton and 38% Trump. 
Clinton is now more popular in New York, California and Michigan. She is likely to win in these states with 
huge margins. Clinton has also gained popularity in Texas (Clinton 65% - Trump 35%). 
Trump has huge support in Ohio (90% Trump - 10% Clinton) and in New Jersey.

Hi Jeffrey, 
Please find attached InsightsPod business plan for your consideration. 
Since Twitter is live streaming the presidential debates, the social media activity will accelerate and it will help 
us in making better predictions of outcome. It was apparent from the US Election report, which I sent you 
previously that we need a Data Scientist who can translate our data into better insights. Taking this into 
account I hope you can help us by backing this venture.

A small point on the election that maybe you think might have some value for HC 
1-In Europe a LOT of citizens start becoming very angry and voting for populist parties 
2-A major reason is that the interconnected world shows them every minute on their smartphones how rich 
people are living and envy sets in (especially with raising inequality that is perfectly normal when financial 
returns of rich people are exponential and work returns are linear) 
3-They want change and risk electing completely wrong people (Italy 5stelle, France LePen might be next, 
Hungary, Greece already lost, Brexit and anti-trade another example) 
4-US election is over, Trump has destroyed himself as expected (I was in Wharton with Donald Jr, 3.95GPA vs. 
2.5 GPA but he thought he was a god... what a family) 
the message: 
5-Maybe HC can use the last debates to create weapons for change. She could acknowledge that she 
understands that people want change, and ask for a clear majority in the senate thinking abou that instead of 
presidential elections. Then if she does bad in 4 years she is out, but she could make the public understand that 
senate is key to show what a president can do. 
But again, I know 0.001% of what you or them understands about politics, I am however worried that europe is 
just 5 or 10 years ahead on this trend compared to the US in anti-establishment feelings and I have seen with 
friends how irrational and influenceable masses can become in voting when they are frustrated (Hitler was 
elected after all...)

I'm a reporter at CNN, and my colleague Blake Ellis and I have read that Bill Clinton and Donald 
Trump have both visited Epstein's private island. We are trying to determine whether there is any 
truth to the allegations that either or both of these men may have had sexual relations with minors 
while there. We know that you have been Epstein's pilot, so we're wondering if you would be willing 
to speak with us completely off the record. We are not focusing on the allegations against Epstein --
we are solely focusing on Trump and Clinton given the current allegations being levied in the press. 
If you don't feel comfortable sharing anything via social media or email, feel free to send us any 
documentation/proof that might be helpful anonymously via mail:

Thanks so much,

Hi Jeffrey, 
Looks like Trump is back in game. We processed 11 million tweets this week for Trump and 50.03% are 
positive and only 20.66% are negative whereas Clinton is 56.05% negative and 20.03% positive. 
We are trying to correlate that into popular vote outcome and electoral votes received.

Please find attached InsightsPod business plan for your consideration. 
Since Twitter is live streaming the presidential debates, the social media activity will accelerate and it 
will help us in making better predictions of outcome. It was apparent from the US Election report, which 
I sent you previously that we need a Data Scientist who can translate our data into better insights. Taking 
this into account I hope you can help us by backing this venture.

Hi Jeff 
The Trump momentum, 
I believe was stopped. 
Hillary might be on her way to Win. But with much lower margin, and probably still GOP controlled Senate.

You are a prophet..

I'll be discussing China-U.S. relations under "President Trump" with the former Chinese Ambassador to the 
U.S on CCTV News ("Closer To china"), broadcast in china and internationally (NY - "CCTV News" channel) - 
Saturday at 8:30 pm and Sunday at 8:30 am New York time. Not an interview - we will each question each 
other 
we're playing in new territory here. There may be some contributions we can make. To be discussed 
privately. I return to Los Angeles on Nov. 17, but dont get to NY until Dec. 24, after my next trip to

From: Dr. Bruce L. Dennis &lt; 
Date: Wed, Nov 9, 2016 at 10:14 AM 
Subject: Responding to yesterday's election 
To: 
&gt; 
Dear Packer Families, 
Like many of you, I am writing this message on very little sleep. Last night was like no other in our 
political memory, defying the predictions of the most erudite pundits and political 
prognosticators. 
Today, we are spending a great deal of time unpacking the election results with our students 
across the three divisions — during morning meeting and throughout the day in Lower School 
classrooms, in Middle School advisories, during Upper School Community time, as well as in 
many individual classroom conversations. I write to assure you that we will do our best to handle 
these discussions with balance, sensitivity, and fairness. 
Given that last week's mock election among Packer's Upper School students showed that over 
8o% favored Secretary Clinton, I don't think it's a huge leap to assume that there was more 
disappointment than joy in Packer households as results unfolded last night. At the same time, 
there are certainly Packer families who support Mr. Trump and are pleased with this outcome. As 
a school community, we have an obligation to recognize that there will be a broad array of feelings 
generated by the election results, and it is our responsibility as a school to make space for these 
feelings to be expressed thoughtfully and compassionately, as well as to model the tolerance and 
acceptance of difference that are among our core values. No doubt, we have our work cut out for 
us, but I am confident in the good that we can do as a community. 
There are abundant lessons to be learned from this election: that experts can be wrong; that our 
country is even more deeply divided than many of us had thought; and that abundant numbers of 
our fellow Americans feel a deep sense of despair and disaffection with the status quo of 
government. For us here at school, we will use this as an opportunity to talk with your children in 
age-appropriate ways about demographics, the economy, social policy, our democratic system, 
and the rule of law. We will also talk about the world's response to yesterday's election results, our 
individual responsibilities as citizens to continue to give voice to our beliefs, and appropriate 
channels of political activism. On a more basic level, we will stress the importance of not being a 
gloating winner or a sore loser, and about the strength of our nation, its history of responding to 
dramatic political change, and the hopefulness of the future. 
As for you, our families, I offer two resources. Last week at a NYSAIS heads-of-school conference 
that I attended, the University of Pennsylvania educator Ali Michael spoke about advancing our 
national dialogue about race. This morning Dr. Michael wrote a Huffington Post piece, "What Do  
We Tell the Children?", a moving yet direct reminder of how we, as adults, can model our 
responses for the young people around us. Next Wednesday, November 16, from 6:3o to 8 
p.m., Semeka Smith-Williams and the PA Diversity Committee are holding a "Post-
Election Healing" evening here at Packer. 
Please reach out if you have questions, suggestions, or simply would like to share your thoughts, 
and take good care. 
Best regards.

Importance: High 
am looking at this from over here in Germany. American politics gets reduced in the end to only a few 
issues: pro-life or pro-choice, gun laws, and establishment vs. anti-establishment. Political categories 
are so wishy washy and intermingled with what is termed 'liberal' and 'conservative' that one forgets 
what they actually mean. 
of course, not everybody who voted for Trump is sexist or a racist, but, on some level, they didn't care 
if he is. He knew how to gather momentum with the discourse he chose, and, even if he changes his tone, 
he has let loose a storm. We will brace ourselves over here for Putin's eventual takeover of the Baltic 
States. Putin has extended his power back into Republic of Georgia, the Crimea, and Armenia. Trump has 
said that he would not come to the aid of Nato allies if they were attacked. Is is the least of our 
problems here in Germany; Erdogan is a much larger threat, for now. 
don't see Hillary Clinton as being at fault. I see the growth of nationalism (all throughout the world, 
not just in the USA) and an underestimation of the fear that non-Hispanic whites have about the 
trajectory they are on to become a minority (in the USA and other European countries). 
Every news show, talk show, etc here is discussing and analysing the fallout of Trump's win. German 
politicians are hoping to learn from it, to stem the growth of the right wing AFD party here. As far as 
know, Merkel is the only leader who congratulated Trump with a warning.

Dear Jeffrey, 
Since your last meeting in Paris and the meeting on site I have had no news from you. I would 
just like to know if you intend to go ahead with the interior design work because Florence is 
blocked and waiting. If you want to do it and since about —70-80-90% of the project is 
approved then why don't we start with what is sure and for the remaining points, such as the 
kitchen, we can see about these the next time you are in Paris. 
As for the kitchen I understand new samples were sent yesterday. These samples are in grey 
which is not a very bright color for a beach house kitchen where perhaps blue might be more 
appropriate. Let's see. 
If you would like us to do the project we will send you a budget recap for the points agreed 
upon along with our first account and fees. 
Big kisses,

Who is the guy you have set me up with? 
Spend zero effort on anything about me w trump. Seeing his approach to conflict of interest, his Putin 
proximity, and his mindless response on Castro death I'm best off a million miles away. 
Until they are deeply humbled by the fuckups that are sure to come, I serve myself and country best by doing 
nothing that involves loyalty to them.

Dear Lesley, 
HORRORS! 
I have committed the (to me) unpardonable error of inflicting upon Jeffrie -- today on the phone - a false

Here is the correct version: 
The letters in PRESIDENT TRUMP -- re-arranged -- spell: MR. PUTIN'S RED PET.

The accepted view of reality holds that human beings exist in the 
context of a vast physical universe "out there." Sir John Eccles, a 
famous British neurologist and Nobel laureate, declared, "I want 
you to realize that there exists no color in the natural world, and no 
sound — nothing of this kind; no textures, no patterns, no beauty, 
no scent." What Eccles means is that all the qualities of Nature, 
from the luxurious scent of a rose to the sting of a wasp and the 
taste of honey, are produced by human beings. The most distant 
galaxies billions of light years away, have no reality without you, 
because everything that makes any galaxy real— with the multitude 
of stars with their heat, emitted light, and masses, the positions of 
the distant galaxies in space and the velocity that carries each 
distant galaxy away at enormous speed—requires a human 
observer with a human nervous system. There are extremely faint 
traces of photon activity in the brain, but the optic nerve doesn't 
transmit photons to the visual

"That's because it isn't, and everyone here 
(apparently save one) is rational and objective enough

phenomena in general, are 
ultimately perceptual in nature and subject to 
observational replication - that's why they call

Consciousness cannot be objectively, replicably

brains and behaviors, can be replicably observed, and 
it can be subjectively

Anyone who denies this understands neither physics 
nor consciousness, and has a severe logic problem to

between cognition and perception or internal and 
external state.

Subject: Trump appears with mobster-affiliated felon at New Year's bash/Joe Cinque 
Importance: High 
Jeffrey --I thought you might be interested in this article-- Nick 
Trump appears with mobster-affiliated felon at New Year's bash 
President-elect Donald Trump rang in the new year together with Joseph "Joey No Socks" Cinque — a 
convicted felon with ties to notorious Gambino crime family boss John Gotti, a recently released video has 
revealed. 
Cinque can be seen in a video obtained by the Palm Beach Daily News  , cheering loudly as a tuxedo-clad 
Trump runs through a number of campaign promises before the hundreds of guests attending the New Year's 
Eve bash the President-elect threw at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida on Saturday. 
"The taxes are coming down, regulations are coming off, we're going to get rid of Obamacare," Trump can be 
heard saying as an exuberant Cinque stands next to him, pumping his fists into the air. 
Cinque's Sunday appearance with Trump might raise some eyebrows. 
Beyond a 1989 felony conviction for possessing nearly $100,000 worth of stolen artwork, Cinque "used to be 
friends with John Gotti," according to a New York Magazine profile from 1995  . 
Cinque was also "shot three times and left for dead" in a 1980 incident that authorities described as "a hit," 
according to the profile. 
Further, Saturday's Mar-a-Lago party was far from the first time Cinque cheered on for Trump. 
An Associated Press report from this spring showed that the American Academy of Hospitality Sciences, a 
company owned and operated by Cinque, has awarded more than a dozen of Trump's golf courses, hotels, 
casinos and private clubs with so-called "Star Diamond" awards "of true excellence in hospitality." 
The same report also found that about half of the roughly 30 people listed as "trustees" to the company are 
Trump friends or business associates. 
Trump, meanwhile, was listed on the company's website as its "ambassador extraordinaire," and he even 
appeared in a 2009 tribute video to Cinque in which he said, "There's nobody like him. He's a special guy." 
But when asked by reporters about Cinque in May, Trump denied knowing anything about him or his criminal 
past. 
"If a guy's going to give you an award, you take it," the President-elect said at the time. "You don't tend to look 
up his whole life story." 
The Trump transition team did not immediately return a request for comment on how the President-elect knows 
Cinque or why they appeared together Saturday. 
While standing alongside Cinque, Trump also took a moment to address the terror attack that left scores of 
nightclub revelers in Istanbul dead over the weekend — and how the bloodbath somehow necessitates a 
Mexican border wall. 
"We will build a wall, you know that. We will build a wall," the President-elect told the raucous crowd. 
"And speaking of walls," he continued. "In Turkey tonight — has anybody heard? Big disaster took place in 
Turkey tonight. Many, many, many people killed...It's a horror show. So we're going to get things running 
properly." 
ISIS claimed responsibility for the Saturday attack  , which left at least 39 people dead and dozens more 
wounded, calling the lone gunman who carried out the massacre a "heroic soldier of the caliphate." The suspect  
had yet to be named and located by Turkish authorities early Tuesday. 
The President-elect made building a wall along the country's southern border one of his main campaign talking 
points, frequently promising his supporters that it will be a "great" and "beautiful" wall. 
But his pledge to construct a border barrier has gone under several renditions, with the President-elect admitting 
in November that it might actually end up "part wall, part fence."

Trump in PBI Fed 3rd thru 5th,. FYI„ 
When PresTrump is visiting MarLago PBI there will be flight restrictions flying in and out of palm beach„ due 
to location of MarLago,. 
There will be GateWay airports you have to depart from in order to land PBI„ 
Teterboro is a gateway departure airport, requires 24 hour notice just like our DCA program, 
When Trump is in MarLago, we will be unable to land in Palm Bch departing from LSJ„ we can land Fort 
Lauderdale Excutive airport, which isn't bad, they are offering $2.76 fuel price this weekend„ 
Same with departure from PBI, need 24 hour notice when President is in town„ 
See message from PBI Port: 
Important Message: All Palm Beach County Airport Users 
We are getting word and expecting a President of the United States (POTUS) visit to PBI / Mar-a-
Lago from Feb 3, 2017 (afternoon?) until Feb. 5, 2017. Times to be established. 
Expect the FAA's Temporary Flight Restriction paperwork to be posted at least 72 hours prior to the POTUS 
arrival. 
The following two airports are in the inner core, inside lONM TFR. 
PBI Airport; All General Aviation traffic into PBI must clear TSA designated "Gateways" for both arrival and 
departures into and out of PBI. Departure Gateways - We expect the Gateways to be established at the multiple 
locations at PBI with TSA operating from 0800-1700 and requires prior reservation (24hrs) with TSA. Arrival 
Gateways — Expect Ft. Lauderdale International Airport (FLL) and Orlando Int'l (MCO). Also expecting 
Teterboro, Dulles, and White Plains as additional gateways. 
LNA Airport; As initially established by the USSS, the Palm Beach County Park Airport (LNA) in Lantana, 
FL will be closed to all departures and flight training. Only arrivals into LNA that have gone through the TSA 
Gateway program at one of the designated airports (FLL/MCO) may fly into LNA during the TFR. 
The 30NM outer core will also be in effect and measures will be posted in the FAA NOTAM/TFR release.

He is wrong about heart rate variability 
Increased heat rate variability is a sign of Well Being even self awareness not decreased variability. It's a sign 
of adaptability and flexibility. 
Rigidity stubbornness and inability to change are associated with decreased heat rate variability and sympathetic

Dear Jeffrey 
Two questions. 
1—do you believe the stock market will continue to climb given what we have now seen of Trump-land? 
[Strictly confidential] 
2—what do you think of the attached (N=1)? You do not drink or smoke, probably do not inject etc. you swim 
or exercise every day, so your heartbeat is expected to be low and less variable than average. Is your ability to 
predict heart rate accurately—without holding your neck or wrist—positively related to your ability to succeed 
in the financial world—as the attached strongly suggests. Just give me and N=1. 
Remember you asked me, what does self-knowledge have to do with anything—and here is a most intriguing 
example. 
I will send you a joke shortly 
All best

The obituary of unique comedian Irwin Corey stated, "Over a career that spanned more than 70 years, Corey 
performed in vaudeville, radio, television, films, Broadway, nightclubs and Las Vegas showrooms." 
In 1983, I was fortunate to be booked as the opening act for Corey in a four-day run at the Julia 
Morgan Theater in Berkeley. He revealed his dark side in a room backstage, where we smoked 
a joint, and he told me how he used to read Nazi hate literature to get him in the mood to 
perform. And there was a certain sense of continuity on his deathbed. The night before he died, he said to a 
close friend, James Drougas, "Trump will be assassinated soon." 
"Professor" Corey also had a humanitarian streak. In 1996, in my magazine, The Realist, I published a photo of 
him, from a video by his son Richard, presenting Fidel Castro a bag of California-grown pistachio nuts (Castro 
said, "California, hmmmm, good climate there for nuts"), a book on the Rosenberg controversy, and a credit-
card-size calculator (Castro said, "I'll have to use my little pinky to push the buttons"). Dave Channon reported 
thatCorey was on a diplomatic mission to lift the embargo on health supplies to Cuba, and he visited a hospital 
that was providing sophisticated treatment for the survivors of Chernobyl. Cuban health care provided for more 
radiation victims than than did the U. .5."

Dear Jeffrey, You mentioned you were friends with Tom Barrack and I wondered if you might introduce me to 
him. As discussed, I'm doing a book on the first 100 days of the Trump White House--POTUS and key staff 
know all about it and are cooperating--and would love to chat with Tom on or off the record. Thanks in advance 
and look forward to seeing you soon. All best, Michael

I am writing a story about how markets keep ripping ahead despite political craziness. VIX so low, etc. 
You must get a lot of this in talking to clients -- people freaking out about headlines as markets hit 
new highs. How do you spin this to them? One hedgie Trump supporter told me that Trump is the 
highest beta prez ever -- ie the highs will be high but so will be the lows. 
Question: how closely does DJT track market moves? I know he tweets about Dow 20,000 but how 
aware do you think he is about how market really betting big on him. Does he talk to Barrack about 
this? Cohn?

Thanks Darren 
Good news! 
I'm under the impression that checks will be exceptional (they are more cumbersome to handle), and we will 
use mostly wires. 
Considering the time difference, my heavy travel and my own propension to do things at night and on week-
ends I would much prefer having an internet code and be able to organize everything online when I need to. 
When I use Interaudi (my US bank), they can do that, store the recurring beneficiaries, and do wires in 
multiple currencies, but I am not familiar with DB. 
Of course, you could also have the same access and help me when needed. 
Also, your point about bookkeeping is mitigated by the fact that, in any case, I will also need to have 
someone keeping track of the receipts and inventory, before shipping proofs to you. In any case there will be 
need for some work on my side before final filing is done. 
On the other hand, if there is a "checks and balances" control issue, there could be a cap to my wiring powers 
(like the 10 K we discussed), that would be absolutely fine for me if this is the intent. 
Please do let me know. 
We can also talk about it (in Hawai now, free after 2 PM your time) 
In any case, this is good and happy news. I'll review the first list of payments over the week-end.

There is $1mm in the bank account. We can prepare checks or wires for you to sign upon request. This way 
book keeping gets done at same time. Just send back up with each request. How does that sound?

Dear Darren

Thanks Darren 
Good news! 
I'm under the impression that checks will be exceptional (they are more cumbersome to handle), and we will 
use mostly wires. 
Considering the time difference, my heavy travel and my own propension to do things at night and on week-
ends I would much prefer having an internet code and be able to organize everything online when I need to. 
When I use Interaudi (my US bank), they can do that, store the recurring beneficiaries, and do wires in 
multiple currencies, but I am not familiar with DB. 
Of course, you could also have the same access and help me when needed. 
Also, your point about bookkeeping is mitigated by the fact that, in any case, I will also need to have someone 
keeping track of the receipts and inventory, before shipping proofs to you. In any case there will be need for 
some work on my side before final filing is done. 
On the other hand, if there is a "checks and balances" control issue, there could be a cap to my wiring powers 
(like the 10 K we discussed), that would be absolutely fine for me if this is the intent. 
Please do let me know. 
We can also talk about it (in Hawai now, free after 2 PM your time) 
In any case, this is good and happy news. I'll review the first list of payments over the week-end.

Hi Jeffrey 
Happy to talk to you almost anytime today until around 3PM. Just tell me what number I should reach. 
Not sure what got lost in translation here: never had the intention to go to any art fair or art show or 
anything of the kind. 
All the artists we have in mind or send to you are people we have direct connections with. Not just their 
studio, but also their home. They are people the work of whom we follow, and many of them are already 
friendly (Arianna, Cali have had dinner or stayed home). 
The idea is absolutely to have an impact on the ecosystem and to make a difference by supporting great 
artists when they need it. 
Galleries references are important, because galleries allow artist to reach a broader audience. We would go 
directly to the source. 
This is why it's important for me to go to LA or Berlin (or elsewhere) because those artists are not rich yet, 
they dont travel so much. They belong to a scene, and it does make a big difference to them if you connect in 
person. 
The spirit is to have an impact on young, talented folks, and absolutely to stay at the source. 
Once again, not sure was drifted away from this in communication

Importance: High 
re your comment on predicting Trump, there is HL Mencken's famous phrase: 
"It is IMPOSSIBLE to underestimate the intelligence of the American people." 
and then from Richard Hofstadter's 1964 book on Ant-intellectualism in American Life: 
"There is a cult of ignorance in the United States, and there has always been. The strain of anti-intellectualism has 
been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that 
democracy means that my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge." 
Only thing stupefying me about Trump so far is that all his EPA appointees come from the great wasteland called 
Oklahoma—Inhofe et al, climate change deniers to the last, but climate change is inescapable and by going back to 
our old way of doing things, it will merely come all the quicker 
all best

Pres. Trump arrives PBI Friday at 6pm is TFR is effective,. If we land before 6pm we are ok. 
Newark is not a gateway airport to PBI, only Teterboro„ 
If you want to arrive in PBI after 6pm,. I can relocate the GIV to Teterboro, 
What time do you estimate wheels up Friday from Newark? Or should I move plane to Teterboro Friday

I was never worried about space.. I always knew he was enamored with human space exploration because it is 
big and showy.. I even wrote that in print early on.. for him that is science.. it isn't for those of us who know.. it 
is more bad news as far as I am concerned because this big budget will decimate real science.. 900 million cut 
in DOE office fo science will kill particle physics.. will end funding for me, for example.. 
you told me you were worried about space and i told you not to worry, he will decimate climate change . and 
support, verifiable projects.

Just remembered, POTUS is in PBI until 4:30pm today,. We Cannot fly from STT to PBI since we are not 
departing from a TSA approved scanning airport. We could land Fort Lauderdale or Stuart only,. If you 
elected to arrive before 4:30pm., 
After 4:30pm PBI arrival is OK,.

Appreciate consideration. I'm next in NY June 7 (for about a week); love to brainstorm.... I too would really 
like to do something (important) together. 
Just arrived in Beijing for the "The Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation" (commentating), the 
second most important event of 2017 in China (after the upcoming Party Congress), but Western media not 
paying much attention, what with All-Things-Trump. 
hope things are well. . when are you back. . I would love to do something with you, but sleep is not going to 
be it. . I have read quite alot and frankly, the subject is fascinating but i see no real insights, just more 
questions and mostly the same ones that have been asked for years. . yes, its role in many processes are now 
becoming apparent. but I see no theories that can hold their own ( yet ).

Mr. Rouhani's supporters also expect his victory, with 57 percent of the vote, to bolster his 
outreach efforts to the West and the pursuit of more foreign investment to lift Iran's ailing 
economy. 
For those who voted for Mr. Rouhani, there was a feeling of tremendous relief that his challenger, 
the hard-line cleric Ebrahim Raisi, who criticized the nuclear deal with the United States and 
other Western powers, had lost. 
"Bye-bye, Raisi," the crowds chanted during the street gatherings. 
"He faces a difficult task," Fazel Meybodi, a Shiite Muslim cleric from the city of Qum, said of Mr. 
Rouhani. "Now he must provide more freedoms, break the hard-line monopoly on the state-run 
radio and television, and increase freedom of press." 
To achieve all that, Mr. Rouhani must persuade the hard-line-dominated judiciary and security 
forces to change their outlook, Mr. Meybodi said. "If he fails to deliver on at least 70 percent of 
those promises, his future is dark," he added. 
For decades, Saudi Arabia and Iran have competed for religious leadership and political influence 
across the Muslim world and beyond. 
Trump is correct, however, Rouhani needs a chance to act.

To achieve all that, Mr. Rouhani must persuade the hard-line-dominated judiciary and security 
forces to change their outlook, Mr. Meybodi said. "If he fails to deliver on at least 70 percent of 
those promises, his future is dark," he added. 
For decades, Saudi Arabia and Iran have competed for religious leadership and political 
influence across the Muslim world and beyond. 
Trump is correct, however, Rouhani needs a chance to act.

I'm against censorship, and that includes Kathy Griffin. CNN eats chickenshit. What she 
did is nothing compared to Trump's murderous evil. 
P.S. THIS LITERALLY REEKS WITH IRONY...THIS IS WHERE CNN GETS ITS 
CHICKENSHIT. A COMMERCIAL THAT THEY'RE LOSING BECAUSE OF KATHY: 
SQUATTY POTTY - KATHY GRIFFIN "FULL OF SHIT" (2017) 
(USA) 
09 May, 201/ By Dabitch 0 Comments 
Second week of May this Kathy Griffin ad rolls out digital media only, where Kathy tells people that they are "full of 
shit." Literally. See, Kathy Griffin has a potty mouth but also a selling point - the reason you'd use the squatty potty 
is to properly empty your bowels. "It's like a colonic" she explains, but without that hose up your ass. A cute blue 
turd bleeps her potty mouth but the point is still made. 
You may remember Squatty Potty's pooping unicorn video created by the Harmon Brothers in 2015. Now Kathy 
Griffin is their first celebrity spokesperson. The brand's CEO and co-creator, Bobby Edwards, finds her quirky, brave 
and fearless, which makes her a good ambassador for the brand as they target women with this campaign. 
Edwards says the brand team fell in love with the "full of shit" idea from Bravery Films, "it got the biggest laughs" 
from staff. Howie Ronay, Bravery Films' founder and chief creative officer, a former FCB exec who worked on the 
2013 viral hit "Ship My Pants" for Kmart explains: "We know a lot of people struggle with this issue, and we decided 
to take a common colloquial phrase and use it literally." Basically, this is "ship my pants II." Enough about poop, not 
all ads can be great.

perhaps its not the important dimension? If some share advantages of luck and otherse dont, the curve flattens, 
or becomes bimodal. one can imagine the fomation of "lucky enclaves" where luck is actually manufactured in 
a sense, and effects kept inthe group and further amplified. In a way, it is a kind of "market" to capture unusual 
events or to create cascades of events that would be otherwise difficult to create, anticipate, or predict?. I was at 
lunch yesterday with Dan Rose and he was saying that all of the major real estate families in NYC (excepting 
Trump) collectively think of the longer-term consequences of their actions for the larger group of dynasties. 
How do these "intentinal" actions affect the natrual probability distributions? Perhaps not at all (!!!) but they 
might shift the curve or displace others at different places in the aggregate population (the curve). Lets keeep 
thinking. 
BTW, this also has implication for my life (and yours)- we want to be members of various "lucky groups" 
(physical, mental, emotional, intellectual, etc), and if we pick the right sub-group, there will be natural 
regression to the mean in that group.... so, surround yourself with people as gifted or more, and use the power of 
RTM? Sometimes, it only works if the gaps are not too large, but I have found it a very useful heuristic in life.... 
in lots of areas. 
When are you back? 
since luck is not zero sum. cant figure out how to move up the curve.

Jeffrey, 
Huffington Post is almost done with their article. They need couple answers to use them for your quotes. Please 
see below. 
Questions for you: 
1. As a result of Trump's budget cuts, more scientists are turning to private donors for funds. How have you 
helped these scientists thrive during this time in particular? 
2. Why do you think it's important to have funded the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics and how will this 
program help us in the future? 
Questions for a scientist (can I ask Martin to answer and quote him)? 
1. How has Jeffery Epstein's donations helped you advance your research? 
Let me know if you have any questions or comments. Would appreciate speedy response.

startup idea - marketplace where a scientist can find a donor. I realize what we've started. We've 
started a new PR campaign to engage donors to support science during Trump's time. 
It can be massive. And you can be a face of if it doesn't sound scary for you G But what I really like

I've contact universal ref Cuba trip: 
Attached is current form they are utilizing,. 
See note from UVAir below: 
Hello Larry, 
This year we have had quite a few successful Cuba trips with clients over the past year or so that Cuba 
travel has resumed. Attached are the rules and regulations that we currently operate under. 
Keep in mind on 16 Jun 2017, President Donald Trump has announced changes that are to come regarding 
Cuban and us relations. This means the regulations are being rewritten to reflect these changes and are 
to be published 30-90 days from that date. We do not have advance notice on how the regulations will be 
written or exactly how it will affect our Cuba licensing but we are sure they will have some impact on 
us 
Until further notice we are still utilizing the attached information. I will keep an eye out for updates 
on Cuba restrictions; however, we should start the process as we have in the past. 
We will need the following documents form you: 
1. In the attached document on page number 10 there is a "cubia BIS Certification Form" we will need this 
filled out by the PIC for the trip. This is a self-authorization form for the aircraft and should be kept 
on file after the trip in case the Department of Treasury asks for it in the future. 
2. We will also need the "Passenger certification" form for each passenger on board. They will need to 
advise purpose of travel under section 1. If they do not fall under any of those then they will need a 
specific license from the Department of Treasury. 
After we receive the above documents for the aircraft and passengers we can start arranging handing and 
landing permits for the trip.

Hi Jeffrey, I was happy to meet you this morning. 
person) 
You asked to see some things I've written. Here's my (only slightly out of date) professional web presence, including 
Letterman clip: 
www.thedylanlove.com  
Here are a few stories I've written more recently that are not displayed on my site:

https://thenextweb.com/contributors/2017/09/14/russians-use-technology-influence-elections  
http://www.businessinsider.com/quantum-technologies-conference-2017-8  
You might get a special kick out of this Trump story: 
https://www.inverse.com/article/20029-transhumanist-presidential-candidate-zoltan-istvan-donald-trump-new-technologies 
What kinds of media goals/story ideas are interesting to you? Masha has made it clear that she wants me to write 
something about you, but that's much more your call to make. I suggest that there is mileage to be gained by quoting you 
in a story about how proper implementation of cryptocurrency might solve financial corruption issues. 
I travel back to Austin, Texas tomorrow evening, but am of course reachable. Thanks again for your time this morning.

this was just tweeted by famous saudi opposition @mujtahidd.. almost 2 million followers.. 
#Trump MBS scandal involving President @realDonaldTrump and Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman... 
Following @realDonaldTrump's visit to SA, US stance on Saudi affairs changed especially on competition 
between MBS &amp; MBN and Qatar siege. 
MBS = Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman (de facto King) 
MBN = Mohammad bin Nayef (deposed Saudi Crown Prince and Interior Minister) 
Prior to @realDonaldTrump, US institutions stood firmly with MBN throughout Obama's presidency. This was 
reaffirmed in a letter to the King. 
After @realDonaldTrump's Riyadh visit, he changed the US stance on the MBS v MBN power struggle and 
forced the establishment to back MBS. 
Past US administrations were keen on avoiding strife within GCC: This is because American interests cannot be 
upheld without a harmonic GCC. 
That was until @realDonaldTrump's return from Saudi upon which Qatar siege began and he openly supported 
it contradicting Defence&amp;State Dept 
That was until @realDonaldTrump's return from Saudi upon which Qatar siege began and he openly supported 
it contradicting Defence&amp;State Dept 
More bizarrely; MBS has a secure direct line to Trump like no other leader has - not even Israeli Netanyahu &amp; 
British May... 
The following story explains MBS's 'special' influence over @realDonaldTrump - even if it means 
compromising America's national interests... 
During @realDonaldTrump's Riyadh visit in May 2017 a private yacht discreetly arrived at Jeddah Port; heavily 
guarded and identity hidden. 
Even the Port's authorities were not allowed near it. Only a number of individuals reached it - delivering several 
boxes of cash ($1bn USD). 
After loading the boxes, the yacht disappeared. The operation lasted hours &amp; was kept secret as was yacht's 
identity, origin and destination 
It transpired from MBS's inner circles that the $ lbn was from MBS himself &amp; the yacht belonged indirectly to 
@Trump Organisation. #Trump MBS

Shouldn't be to bad if we are leaving early and Trump is not scheduled to depart until 3pm on Sunday, the 
Departure will be similar to a DCA Departure with Customs, 
TSA will have an office set up inside the FBO, you will enter the main lobby at Atlantic and be escorted to the 
plane after you meet with TSA officers., 
I have to schedule all passengers names 24hours in advance, no additions within 24 Hours, 
Thx

Perfect. You should ping SB. He has some weird ADD thing. You remind him tho and he sometimes clicks 
back into plan. 
he in keeping with past tradtion said he would confirm a time around 11 . no word since. . the example you 
might use, was when john mccain was grilling comey, and made some really weird statements everone 
looked at each other, with a " what is going on: " look, it turned out to be a brain tumor. . eveyone looks 
now with the same , WTF , look, at trump but has no idea what the future holds.

Most operators are using Boca for arrivals when Trump is in town. Parking reservation at Boca are required 
since the ramp fill up. Other options is Fort Lauderdale when Boca is full.

Hi Jeff, 
I realize the last term sheet was a draft, my fault (my computer sync'd the draft with the same name). 
Here is a correct version, the last page is the signature page. It would be great if I could get this back 
tomorrow. Nothing is due until the recap is complete, hopefully in about 4 weeks. I am planning to start those 
discussions the end of next week. 
Things are going well. The more I learn the more excited I get. I will be at Tarana tomorrow 
discussing a window mount version to try to get to self-install. lgbps in a self-install package would be the last 
step. 
We will only need a tower ever 4-5km in the city, which is basically 2 or 3 rooftops for all of Boston. 
I met with American Tower today (I know their CEO and CTO) and they have plenty of room on the John 
Hancock. 
Fun Stuff and great to be doing something together!

i think this is a good point Jeffrey but i do think they are rarely sacrificed—certainly not Saddam or the sadistic 
Assads or Donald 
have you heard that Genghis Khan—for all i know a gentle nomadic warrior—left 5 million Y chromosomes in 
his wake, surviving today? 
45% of marriages in Iraq are with first cousins of the doubly paternal kind—father's brother's child and this has 
been said to lead to easy fracturing of the country which only a powerful dictator like Saddam could contain 
of course "we" destroyed the country and it lies in ruins now—one end to the other 
leave tomorrow for Ft Lauderdale and then Sunday on to California 
as always, if you have an hour or so i will be there 
all best 
i think you might be missing the benefit of the psycopath to the group. he is the defender easily 
sacrificed, but strkes fear in the heart of the other tribes, they are needed as best warriors 
On Sun, Mar 18, 2018 at 11:19 PM, Robert Trivers________________________________ vrote: 
dear men 
i am writing you both because i am attaching a still not-quite-complete response to Peter Richerson, a gene-
culture co-evolutionist—without the genes 
i do so because four lines down i tell the "Gruterites"—Gordon Getty's echo chamber—that i have added you 
two to the list 
so here is your chance to say "no way" and i will delete that from the message and likewise not ask Gruter's 
assistant to add your names to the list 
having said that, i find Gordon's missives much less burdensome than those from EDGE and certainly without 
the egomaniacal nonsense that infects John Brockman—the key is to get the brightest minds in a room and 
have them tell each other what they think is most important—or some such nonsense 
neither David nor i can think of a single scientific advance achieved that way—most of what we do is simply 
concentrated sustained thought directed toward the foundations of a problem 
i doubt Jeffrey has made a huge amount of money via the EDGE program 
unless you say otherwise, i will shortly send you the key Getty missives in which he asserts, i believe 
correctly, that Trump is an archetypal narcissistic psychopath—or whatever the precise term is—and that he 
must be opposed with full force on that basis 
meanwhile, David has heard plenty about you Jeffrey, a financial/mathematical mind of exceptional quality 
and you should know that David is one of the very top evolutionary geneticists still breathing and my teacher 
on every detail large and small 
in haste and all best

Rumor at the PBI airport is President Trump is due to arrive PBI Monday the 16th and stay until 23rd or 
24th , 
This means we can only arrive in PBI from Teterboro after the 16th.

Tae Kim 
'74-14130r. 
Several of President Donald Trump's advisors are pushing him to pardon Michael Milken, 
Bloomberg News reported Friday. 
Michael Milken, 71, was known as the "junk bond king" in the 1980s and was convicted for 
securities fraud. 
Bloomberg said former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci, 
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, senior advisor Jared Kushner and attorney Rudy  
Giuliani support the pardon for Milken. 
Milken has a net worth of $3.7 billion, according to Forbes. The financier, who pioneered 
the market for high-yield bonds while at Drexel Burnham Lambert, was sentenced to 10 
years in prison and permanently banned from the securities industry by the Securities and 
Exchange Commission. His prison term was reduced to two years. 
The White House and a spokesperson for the Milken Institute did not immediately respond 
to requests for comment.

i think we have divergent views on Trump and trade for obvious reasons 
the best economists say all-out trade war will cost the WORLD 2-3% of its GDP 
this can hardly help the stock market 
but the "perturbations" are meat for you—if you can see what to buy and sell ahead of time—or very quickly—

I understand your frustrations and appreciate your willingness to figure out a solution. I have some ideas which I will 
send you over the weekend if that is OK. 
Re Broadcom: the stock is up $1.20 at $211.50. After the initial shock reaction of yesterday, there has been a lot of 
focus on the cost synergies etc. but very little conviction in revenue opportunities. However until we hear from 
management as to the overall intentions of the deal, uncertainty will linger. 
This morning the pricing is as follows: 
Aug 200 Puts cost $4.10 
Sept 200 Puts cost $7.90 
Earning are on 08/30. So worst case is the uncertainty lingers until then which would argue to buy the Sept puts. 
However I still prefer buying the Aug puts as I would fully expect more clarity from management before August expiry.

My initial recommendation this morning was to buy the $200 Aug puts. I still think that is the best idea. The stock is now 
down 16% on a deal that no one fully understands. The CEO has a good track record regarding mergers. So I think it 
makes sense to keep the stock and own protection for the next 35 days until we hopefully get more clarity from 
management.

send you over the weekend if that is OK. 
Re Broadcom: the stock is up $1.20 at $211.50. After the initial shock reaction of yesterday, there has been a lot of 
focus on the cost synergies etc. but very little conviction in revenue opportunities. However until we hear from 
management as to the overall intentions of the deal, uncertainty will linger. 
This morning the pricing is as follows: 
Aug 200 Puts cost $4.10 
Sept 200 Puts cost $7.90 
Earning are on 08/30. So worst case is the uncertainty lingers until then which would argue to buy the Sept puts. 
However I still prefer buying the Aug puts as I would fully expect more clarity from management before August expiry.

Importance: High 
We own 8000 shares on the thesis that their growing exposure to data center capex spend would be a big positive for 
the stock. 
Recommendation: Keep the stock and buy Aug $200 puts on the 8000 shares costing $6.50 or $52,000. Nothing has 
changed regarding their core business. Data center spending is not going to change based off this M&amp;A transaction. 
However if I am wrong and the market further penalizes the stock at least our losses are contained. The stock has 
dropped $40 and I think we could easily recoup our premium if the market buys into the CEO's reason for the merger. 
If I never had a position I would absolutely buy the stock using options. I would be selling October $185 puts and buying 
Oct $220 calls costing 50c/share.

GOP fundraiser Broidy under investigation 
for alleged effort to sell government 
influence, people familiar with probe say 
Carol D. Leonnig 
The Justice Department is investigating whether longtime Republican fundraiser Elliott 
Broidy sought to sell his influence with the Trump administration by offering to deliver U.S. 
government actions for foreign officials in exchange for tens of millions of dollars, 
according to three people familiar with the probe. 
As part of the investigation, prosecutors are scrutinizing a plan that Broidy allegedly 
developed to try to persuade the Trump government to extradite a Chinese dissident back to 
his home country, a move sought by Chinese President Xi Jinping, according to two of the 
people. 
They are also investigating claims that Broidy sought $75 million from a Malaysian business 
official if the Justice Department ended its investigation of a development fund run by the 
Malaysian government. The Malaysian probe has examined the role of the former prime 
minister in the embezzlement of billions of dollars from the fund. 
A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment. Christopher Clark, an attorney 
for Broidy, declined to comment. 
Broidy's alleged activities were detailed in news reports earlier this year that cited hacked 
emails. The Los Angeles-based venture capitalist, who served as top fundraiser for the 
Republican Party and President Trump, has said  that allegations against him are an effort by 
his enemies to smear him. 
Rudolph W. Giuliani, an attorney for Trump, said he had no knowledge of any request for 
records related to Broidy. The White House referred a request for comment to the 
Republican National Committee, which declined to comment. 
[Trump fundraiser Elliott Broidy sues Qatar alleging cyber smear campaign] 
In recent weeks, prosecutors with the Justice Department's public integrity section___which 
examines possible political and government corruption___have sought documents related to 
Broidy's business dealings. 
Among the information sought by investigators are details about Broidy's work on behalf of 
and interactions with the Chinese and Malaysian officials, according to two people familiar 
with the document requests. 
As part of their efforts, prosecutors have subpoenaed casino magnate Steve Wynn, the 
former RNC finance chairman and longtime Trump friend, for copies of records and 
communications related to Broidy. 
An attorney for Wynn, Reid Weingarten, declined to comment, saying only that Wynn is 
cooperating with the Justice Department. 
"Steve Wynn is completely cooperating with the investigation and he certainly has no reason 
to believe that anyone acted improperly in anything he knew about or was involved in," 
Weingarten said in a statement. 
Wynn was tapped by Trump to serve as the RNC 's lead fundraiser after the election. Earlier 
this year, he stepped down from that post and from his executive role at his resort company 
after reports of sexual misconduct. Wynn has denied the allegations of inappropriate 
behavior. 
The public integrity probe is the latest legal challenge for Broidy, who helped corral big  
donors to support Trump's presidential campaign, throwing a lavish fundraiser for the then-
nominee at his Los Angeles-area home during the 2016 campaign. After the election, he was 
appointed to serve as a national deputy chairman for the RNC. 
Broidy sought to parlay his party role and connections to the White House and on Capitol 
Hill in pitches to foreign governments, according to a person with direct knowledge of his 
activities. 
In April, he resigned from his RNC position in the wake of a report that he had paid a former 
Playboy model $1.6 million in exchange for her silence about a sexual affair. Trump's 
personal attorney, Michael Cohen___another RNC fundraiser___helped arrange the 
settlement, Broidy acknowledged. 
[RNC deputy finance chair steps down after admitting Trump's lawyer negotiated settlement 
between him and pregnant Playboy model] 
Cohen is under investigation by federal prosecutors in Manhattan who are examining 
whether he fraudulently obtained millions of dollars in loans and whether his efforts to 
squash negative stories about Trump during the campaign violated election law. 
Broidy's business dealings captured the attention of investigators for special counsel Robert 
S. Mueller III, who asked at least one witness about Broidy's activities, according to a 
person familiar with the matter. 
Broidy's attempts to solve high-level headaches for the Chinese and Malaysian governments 
were first reported this spring by the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times, which 
cited in part a cache of hacked emails. 
Broidy has said the documents were stolen by enemies seeking to ruin his reputation. 
"This whole narrative is a fabrication driven by hackers who want to undermine me," Broidy 
said in a statement to the Times. Earlier this year, he filed a lawsuit against the country of 
Qatar, alleging that it hacked his email accounts in retaliation for his allegations that Qatar 
supports terrorists. A spokesman for the Qatari government has called the suit "without fact 
or merit. 
,1 
The Journal reported in March that, according to a draft contract, Broidy and his wife, Robin 
Rosenzweig, were seeking $75 million from Malaysian businessman Jho Low if federal 
prosecutors dropped their investigation into a Malaysian state investment fund. 
The Justice Department has filed civil suits claiming $4.5 billion in public money was 
misappropriated from the fund, 1Malaysia Development Berhad, seeking to claim a portion 
of those assets. Last month, Malaysian authorities charged former prime minister Najib 
Razak with embezzling billions in public money from the fund. 
Clark, the Broidy attorney, told The Journal that Rosenzweig's firm had been hired to 
provide strategic advice to Low, adding that "at no time did Mr. Broidy or Ms. Rosenzweig, 
or anyone acting on their behalf, discuss Mr. Low's case with President Trump, any member 
of his staff, or anyone at the U.S. Department of Justice." 
The Times reported  in April that Broidy had explored ways to force Chinese exile Guo 
Wengui to leave the United States. The billionaire businessman had fled China in 2014 as he 
was facing arrest for a range of charges, including corruption. Guo has said the allegations 
were fabricated by a government that wants to silence him. 
Since his arrival in the U.S., Guo has publicly detailed allegations of corruption in the 
Chinese ruling party. 
The Times reported that Broidy drafted a plan to enlist Emirati officials to pressure the U.S. 
to turn over Guo. In his statement to the newspaper, Broidy said he "never had a strategy or 
plan regarding Mr. Guo nor was there any compensation given or even discussed." 
Broidy's alleged efforts to push for Guo's extradition came after Wynn separately helped 
deliver a message from the Xi government seeking to have the dissident returned to China, 
according to a person familiar with the effort. 
Wynn, who has contacts with Chinese officials because of his business interests in Macau, 
hand-delivered a letter to Trump seeking Guo '5 deportation, The Journal reported  last year. 
A spokesman for Wynn Resorts has said that the report about Wynn's role was false. 
At the time, the president expressed interest in assisting the Chinese, but was met with 
resistance by senior law enforcement officials, according to the person. 
White House officials did not respond to requests for comment.

China's big tech stocks have fallen into a bear 
market at the same time that regulatory threats 
against U.S. big tech companies are gaining 
momentum. Can U.S. big tech stocks soldier on 
alone or is this a harbinger that the group as a whole 
is losing its tremendous leadership position?

In recent months, China's BAT collapse has demonstrated how costly the expectation of 
invincibility can be—Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent are all down more than 24% 
from their year-to-date closing highs. Citigroup's head of Asia strategy, Mohammed 
Apabhai, told CNN an apt analogy about the investor sentiment that led to BAT's collapse, 
likening "the exuberance for tech stocks to the Looney Tunes cartoons in which Wile E. 
Coyote chases Road Runner over a cliff." Given they've more or less moved in 
tandem for years, will FAANG follow the same path as BAT?

The BAT collapse was triggered by subpar earnings and a shifting regulatory environment 
in China. Facebook's miss in 2Q18—which drove a $120 billion single-day market cap 
loss, the biggest ever for a U.S. company—showed how decisive a turn could be if more 
U.S. tech darlings stumble this quarter. 
There are mounting fundamental reasons to question the 3Q18 earnings 
prospects of FAANG, from the accelerating user backlash against Facebook to Apple's 
trade war exposure to Amazon's rapidly-intensifying workforce revolt that could see the e-
commerce giant left with no option but to raise wages and improve workplace conditions 
for its warehouse and Whole Foods employees. 
However, as Apabhai suggests, the message BAT is sending is less about earnings, and 
more about the cost of exuberance. And FAANG exuberance faces threats that go beyond 
fundamentals. A flurry of regulatory announcements last week signaled the 
political tide has turned in the U.S. Across every branch of government, the 
message was consistent: the U.S. no longer trusts tech giants to self-
police. And the public agrees—according to a Gallup poll last month, 79% of 
Americans now believe "tech companies should be regulated the same way 
the news media is." 
Regardless of political will, threats may not turn to action in the near term. Nonetheless, 
FAANG appears increasingly vulnerable to a decisive sentiment shift. At some point, the 
relentless barrage of bad news will force investors to begin pricing in regulatory risks. Any 
sustained stumble by FAANG's leadership could cripple exuberance, and cause an 
unraveling of passive and algorithmic strategies that are heavily overweight tech 
(see W/LTWApril 7, 2018 for more). We will continue to watch closely to estimate 
timing, but given SAT's collapse, today more than ever, acute scrutiny of tech 
giant leadership is required. 
Through August 28, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft had accounted for greater than 35% of 
the S&amp;P 500's total return this year, according to S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices data. It took 
Amazon just 165 trading days to grow its market value from $600 billion in January to $1 
trillion. The combined market cap of FAAMG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and 
Google) now sits over $4 trillion, or roughly equal to the combined market cap of the 283 
smallest S&amp;P 500 members. 
Tech's continued market leadership means investors have largely discounted 
the mounting risks tech giants face. We have been warning about the downsides of 
tech giant monopolism for more than two years in these pages, from surveillance/data 
security concerns to anticompetitive behavior and their role in escalating inequality. For 
the political establishment, for the media, for the public, this year has seen a 
broad awakening—the Cambridge Analytica scandal, the backlash against Jeff Bezos' 
astonishing wealth, and tech's ever-skyrocketing market caps were all warning signs. The 
past month signals a new phase has begun: from a distant rumbling of change 
to preparation for action. 
The number of significant tech-related regulatory developments that have emerged from 
the U.S. and the E.U. in recent weeks is nothing short of staggering. Here is an 
abbreviated list: 
• President Trump attacked Google for liberal bias, and claimed Google, Facebook, 
and Amazon represent "a very antitrust situation". 
• Attorney General Jeff Sessions convened a meeting of Republican state 
attorneys general to discuss whether tech giants "may be hurting competition and 
intentionally stifling the free exchange of ideas on their platforms." 
• Facebook, Twitter, and Google were called to testify in front of the House and Senate 
about election interference, political bias, etc. Google declined to attend. 
• The FTC has begun a series of hearings on Digital Age antitrust, the first such 
hearings since the 1990s. 
• The FTC revealed the hiring of Lina Kahn—heralded for authoring a groundbreaking 
antitrust argument against Amazon—as an advisor. (See section 5 for more.) 
• Republican Senator Orrin Hatch asked the FTC to reopen a 2013 
antitrust case against Google. 
• Democratic Senator Mark Warner released a six-point policy proposal on regulating 
the tech industry. 
• Democratic Senator Bernie Sanders proposed the "BEZOS Act", which would tax 
corporations one dollar for every dollar low-wage workers receive in government health-
care benefits or food stamps. 
• The E.U. Parliament voted 438 to 226 to back a draft proposal of 
copyright reformsthat will impose unprecedented liability on information platforms. 
• France is pushing to have "Right to be Forgotten" laws applied globally, 
which Google is now fighting in court. 
• Reports emerged that the E.U. is considering investigating Google's location-
tracking practices on data privacy grounds. 
We will continue to watch each development in the U.S. and E.U. closely to understand if 
and when debate turns to action. For now, we agree with the analysis of NYU Stern 
professor Scott Galloway, who told CNBC last week after the congressional hearings: 
I don't see anything meaningful coming out of this panel, much less Washington...D.C. 
lacks the domain expertise or the will to go after big tech. Where you may 
see it is, one, out of Brussels and, two, out of [the FTC, the DOJ, or] a red 
state whose attorney general sees the brightest path between the AG's mansion and the 
governor's mansion is a populist argument against big tech. 
Evidence of fundamental weakness could exacerbate the investor reaction to escalating 
regulatory news. By all accounts, Facebook has continued to bleed 
users. According to Pew Research poll results released earlier this month, more than a 
quarter of U.S. Facebook users claim to have deleted the app from their phones over the 
past year:

Then there's Apple. The trade war combined with China's slowing economy present a 
significant short-term threat to the company's profits. As we note in section 
1, smartphone handset sales in China in August were reported at 32.6 million 
units, a decline of 20.9% year-over-year and 11.8% month-on-
month. Moreover, no firm could suffer more if China decides to target tech 
supply chains in retaliation to Trump's tariffs. 
Yet, the risks extend beyond Asia. On Wednesday, Apple announced its newest generation 
of iPhones. It is following the same strategy as last year, releasing ever-more expensive 
phones as it tries to keep profit growth on pace despite a largely-matured smartphone 
market. As The Wall Street Journal reported this week, projections suggest last year's 
$1,000 iPhone X underperformed previous launches: "Even for Apple and its devoted 
fans, the art of the upsell appears to have some limits...Analysts believe the 
iPhone X has accounted for about 30% of iPhone unit sales in the recent nine-month 
period...That is below the share the company's newest models typically get in a given 
cycle." Will a $1,200 iPhone cross the limits of what the market will tolerate? 
We have roughly a month until 3Q18 earnings season begins. For years, big tech's 
remarkable profit trajectory has generated an air of invincibility. BAT's earnings miss 
combined with Facebook's earnings miss has cracked that expectation. As news reports 
of regulatory threats continue to flood in and as tech giant profit doubts 
mount, the weeks to come could see that crack turn to a fissure.

In recent months, China's BAT collapse has demonstrated how costly the expectation of 
invincibility can be—Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent are all down more than 24% 
from their year-to-date closing highs. Citigroup's head of Asia strategy, Mohammed 
Apabhai, told CNN an apt analogy about the investor sentiment that led to BAT's collapse, 
likening "the exuberance for tech stocks to the Looney Tunes cartoons in which Wile E. 
Coyote chases Road Runner over a cliff." Given they've more or less moved in 
tandem for years, will FAANG follow the same path as BAT?

The Guardian has learned that Rubenfeld is currently the subject of an internal investigation at Yale. The 
investigation is focused on Rubenfeld's conduct, particularly with female law students. Students have also 
raised related concerns to Yale authorities about Chua's powerful influence in the clerkships process. The 
investigation was initiated before Kavanaugh was nominated by Donald Trump to serve on the high court. 
Rubenfeld said in a statement to the Guardian: "In June, Yale University informed me that it would conduct 
what it terms an 'informal review' of certain allegations, but that to preserve anonymity, I was not entitled to 
know any specifics. As a result, I do not know what I am alleged to have said or done. I was further advised that 
the allegations were not of the kind that would jeopardize my position as a long-tenured member of the faculty.

Essay 1. 
Coming from an international background, and having lived in Oslo, Tel Aviv, New York and London by the age of eighteen, I 
believe that the international profile of NYU will provide the best environment for my college education, with the added benefit of 
returning to the place where I've spent most of my childhood and where my mother will be posted as Norwegian Ambassador to the 
UN in January 2019. 
NYU's Art History department appeals to me because of its wide range of courses, from the global art of antiquity to the 
contemporary. My passion is the Italian Renaissance and the rich history behind it, especially the works of 15th century masters such 
as Masaccio and Bellini. Some of the courses that NYU offers such as "Early masters of Italian Renaissance painting" and "Florentine 
Villas: An Interpretation Based on Historical, Social Factors" are, therefore appealing to me. What I find exciting, is not only the 
visual aesthetics and analysis of these masterpieces, but also the manner in which the Renaissance emphasised scientific and 
economic innovation, areas of study the Global Liberal Arts programme would offer. NYU's unique campus in Florence would give 
me a once in lifetime opportunity to spend a year immersing myself in the art, culture and history of Italy. This would be an exciting 
experience to have while studying for a Bachelor's degree in Art History, and would compliment my main interests in the subject. 
As one of the prime cultural centres in the world, NYU's location in NYC is the perfect place to broaden knowledge within 
contemporary art. I am very much looking forward to visiting the Whitney Biennia this May. In addition the New museum, which 
shows a lot of the kind of work I find interesting is a short walk away from campus. 
Taking advantage of being based in central London for the past year, I have completed the Chairman's Programme at Christies, work 
experience at the Courtauld Gallery and I will be working at Maddox Gallery in the near future. Similarly, I want to take advantage of 
being based in NYC to gain as much experience as possible. I have chosen to apply Early Decision to NYU as it is the only American 
university I will be applying to, as there is no better place to obtain experience of the contemporary art world than New York City. 
Essay 2. 
From the age of extremes to the age of bewilderment 
What captivates me more than anything else is the different ideological phases of the 20th century and how art can be used as a 
tool of advancement and reflection on ideological and political developments. 
My fascination began when I read; Eric Hobsbawm's "Age Of Extremes" and has since developed through books such as 
Benjamin Carter Heft's "The Death Of Democracy" and Yuval Harari "A Brief History Of Tomorrow" and "21 Lessons For 
The 21st Century". 
In the years after the First World War, until the end of the Second World War, three political models for shaping the future of 
nation states emerged; Fascism, Communism and liberal democracy. These all offered great ideas for the future of the world. 
Fascism and Communism shared some common features: authoritarian, strong leaders and a belief that their revolutions had to 
be carried through with violence. This led to the mass murders in the Nazi concentration camps and in the Soviet Gulags. 
In the mid war periods, the "Litfass columns" that were originally designed to carry advertising, became the outdoor galleries 
for the war of ideologies. The political poster was born. High quality posters from every political party in Germany popped up 
on the columns. Hitler's propaganda chief G8ebels stated that the Nazi election campaign should be run through speeches and 
posters. The other parties responded in kind. An art form thus became an essential political tool in the battle for votes. The 
propagandist Art used by the Nazis and communists alike was essential in helping sell their message to the masses. 
Indeed, much of the art that was critical of these movements was suppressed or censored and "subversive" artists cowed, in 
some cases imprisoned or even worse. 
The liberal democratic model departed sharply from these authoritarian perspectives by presenting the alternative of free and 
transparent elections, the rule of law and freedom of speech. In the mid-war period the three narratives were competing to be the 
conceptual frame for society. After the Second World War fascism was crushed leaving the two competing ideologies of 
communism and liberal democracy. After the demise of communism in 1989, through to the late 1990's, liberal democracy was 
victorious in the idealogical battlefield. Some historians, like Francis Fukuyama, went so far as to proclaim this period as "the 
end of history". 
A key piece of art that championed this kind of ideology was Sheppard Fairey's campaign poster for Barack Obama. In this 
poster, Fairey, a well established graffiti artist uses urban colours and stencilling techniques combined with the message 
"HOPE" to promote the incoming presidents positive values and popularity with the young. It is notable that Fairey's most 
recent political poster protests the Trump presidency rather than promote it. 
With the rise of so called "illiberal democracy", with strong parties standing for populist ideologies, we have now moved into 
what can be described as the age of bewilderment. We were not in fact at the "end of history". Once again the future looks 
unpredictable and insecure and artists are responding in different ways. 
Jeremy Deller, a British Turner prize winning artist created a work which features a car damaged in the bombing of the historic 
Mutanabbi Street book market, which resulted in the deaths of 38 people. Here, an art work has been used to show the aftermath 
of an event. This event was the result of the Iraq war, which was seen as a way to spread democracy. Here Art is used as a 
means by which to explore the effects of ideology rather than promote it, another really interesting area in the study of the 
intersections between ideology and art. 
Exploring how art reflects the historical and ideological contexts of the world around it is fascinating to me and I would love to 
study these ideas in more depth at undergraduate level.

Beijing plans to give its 22 million residents behavioral report cards as China moves toward higher-

has been made easier by mobile technology and existing state restrictions on electronic 
anonymity. Getting an "F" on this test doesn't mean staying after school, though. The

Slowing economy could increase pressure on 
Big Tech 
Sara Fischer, David McCabe, Courtenay Brown5 hours ago 
A potential recession, combined with increasing regulatory threats for some of the biggest 
tech companies, foreshadows a difficult 2019 for Silicon Valley. 
Why it matters: The biggest tech companies have already raked in billions of dollars in 
profits and benefited from major tax cuts that aren't going to be repeated, so next year isn't 
likely to be better for them financially. They've also been dogged by scandals that have left 
many questioning their positive role in society, and if on top of that the economy starts to 
slip, 2019 could be worse. 
"People look for scapegoats in a bad economy. And with big tech already on its heels, a 
downturn probably would feed arguments that the largest internet companies are too big 
and need to be reined in." 
— Paul Gallant, an analyst with Cowen Washington Research Group 
Big Tech is closing out a contentious year in Washington, and potential regulation will 
continue to haunt it well into 2019. 
• Google CEO Sundar Pichai has agreed to testify before Congress, and will likely be 
asked about whether the company is being transparent about its data privacy practices and 
any potential bias. By the year's end, the CEOs of Twitter, Google and Facebook will have 
been called to testified in front of Congress for the first time ever during 2018. 
• Lawmakers in the United States are pushing for a federal privacy law with an urgency 
likely to be exacerbated by more breaches like the one Marriott disclosed last Friday. 
• The Federal Trade Commission still has an open investigation into whether 
Facebook's conduct violated a previous settlement with the agency. Margrethe Vestager, 
Europe's aggressive commissioner overseeing competition, is still investigating aspects of 
Google's business and whether Amazon plays fair in the market for generic products. 
• President Trump has said his administration is seriously looking into monopolistic 
behavior of Facebook, Google and Amazon. 
Some analysts predict an economic slowdown___even if it doesn't lead to a recession like 
the one in 2008___will be enough to change the global attitude around big American 
companies. 
"So the really shocking thing this year is that the only major economy in the world where 
growth has actually accelerated this year is America. And this is because of the tax cuts, the 
deregulation, the other stimulus which has been put into work. And that has also helped the 
earnings of companies. My point is, from next year onwards, those effects begin to fade." 
— Ruchir Sharma, chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley on Fareed Zakaria GPS  
on Sunday 
The "FAANG" stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google) that pushed the 
stock market to record highs have not been immune from this year's market rout. 
• "The mood has changed. Investors are asking a lot more questions right now," says 
Larry Glazer, a Managing Partner at Mayflower Advisors, which manages $3 billion. 
"Momentum has faded on these names." 
• Adding to potential concern: possible regulatory action could translate into higher 
costs, particularly for Google or Facebook. 
• "Facebook has been under such a dark cloud for so long that now everybody is 
expecting the worst," Paul Meeks, a technology portfolio manager at Wireless Fund, told 
Amos. 
The other side: "I don't see a looming recession. And even if there was, people aren't going 
to target these companies if there is a recession," says Nicholas Economides, Professor of 
Economics at NYU Stem School of Business. 
• Economides argues that, even if there was a mild reduction in GDP growth, it 
wouldn't significantly impact the high tech sector. 
• For companies like Google, Facebook and Twitter, "their main revenue streams are 
from ads. They gain market share from brands converting traditional ad spend to digital ads. 
This conversion is not so dependent on the growth of GDP, because they are still in the 
process of converting ads of different formats to digital ads, and that's something that will 
continue, regardless of GDP growth." 
The bottom line: Tech companies that have long been the darlings of investor portfolios 
will likely find themselves in much weaker positions.

Facebook's conduct violated a previous settlement with the agency. Margrethe Vestager, 
Europe's aggressive commissioner overseeing competition, is still investigating aspects of 
Google's business and whether Amazon plays fair in the market for generic products. 
• President Trump has said his administration is seriously looking into monopolistic 
behavior of Facebook, Google and Amazon. 
Some analysts predict an economic slowdown___even if it doesn't lead to a recession like 
the one in 2008___will be enough to change the global attitude around big American 
companies. 
"So the really shocking thing this year is that the only major economy in the world where 
growth has actually accelerated this year is America. And this is because of the tax cuts, the 
deregulation, the other stimulus which has been put into work. And that has also helped the 
earnings of companies. My point is, from next year onwards, those effects begin to fade." 
— Ruchir Sharma, chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley on Fareed Zakaria GPS  
on Sunday 
The "FAANG" stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google) that pushed the 
stock market to record highs have not been immune from this year's market rout. 
• "The mood has changed. Investors are asking a lot more questions right now," says 
Larry Glazer, a Managing Partner at Mayflower Advisors, which manages $3 billion. 
"Momentum has faded on these names." 
• Adding to potential concern: possible regulatory action could translate into higher 
costs, particularly for Google or Facebook. 
• "Facebook has been under such a dark cloud for so long that now everybody is 
expecting the worst," Paul Meeks, a technology portfolio manager at Wireless Fund, told 
Amos. 
The other side: "I don't see a looming recession. And even if there was, people aren't going 
to target these companies if there is a recession," says Nicholas Economides, Professor of 
Economics at NYU Stem School of Business. 
• Economides argues that, even if there was a mild reduction in GDP growth, it 
wouldn't significantly impact the high tech sector. 
• For companies like Google, Facebook and Twitter, "their main revenue streams are 
from ads. They gain market share from brands converting traditional ad spend to digital ads. 
This conversion is not so dependent on the growth of GDP, because they are still in the 
process of converting ads of different formats to digital ads, and that's something that will 
continue, regardless of GDP growth." 
The bottom line: Tech companies that have long been the darlings of investor portfolios 
will likely find themselves in much weaker positions.

The allegation: Harth claimed that Trump made repeated unwanted sexual advances as she and her romantic 
partner at the time, George Houraney, pursued a business relationship with the mogul in the early 1990s. She 
said that on January 24, 1993, at Mar-a-Lago, Trump offered her a tour of the estate, then pulled her into his 
daughter Ivanka's empty bedroom. 
"He pushed me up against the wall, and had his hands all over me and tried to get up my dress again," Harth 
said, "and I had to physically say: 'What are you doing? Stop it.' It was a shocking thing to have him do this 
because he knew I was with George, he knew they were in the next room. And how could he be doing this when 
I'm there for business?" 
In 1997 Harth and Houraney sued Trump for breach of contract, and she filed a separate sexual-harassment suit, 
accusing him of "attempted rape." They reached a confidential settlement in the contract suit, and as part of the 
agreement Harth withdrew her suit.

this is only the first quarter of the game. if you call a time out, its on the field and done with dignity, you 
cant retreat into the locker room and send a note to the opposing side. in the next quarter she will

Sarah Silverman on Al 
Franken, Louis C.K., Losing 
Her Hulu Show and More 
In the premiere episode of 'The Last Laugh' podcast, Sarah Silverman speaks out for the first 
time about her Hulu show's cancelation and goes to bat for her friend Al Franken. 
Matt Wilstein

Wearing a rainbow-striped hoodie and a "Beer Nuts" baseball cap, Sarah Silverman strode into our 
Burbank recording studio ready to talk. 
It had been just a few weeks since Hulu had unceremoniously canceled her weekly show I Love You,  
America and the comedian's emotions were still a bit raw. But her unflappable sense of humor was 
fully intact as she recounted to me how she found out the bad news and ended up revealing more than 
ever before about how the streaming service treated her over the past year. 
During our long conversation for the first-ever episode of my new podcast The Last Laugh, Silverman 
also spoke frankly about what it has been like to see her friend Al Franken accused of alleged sexual  
misconduct and attempted to clarify the controversial comments she made to Howard Stern about  
Louis C.K. She reflected on some of her most iconic roles and looked ahead to what comes next. 
Highlights from the interview are below and you can listen to the whole thing right now by subscribing 
to The Last Laugh on Apple Podcasts, the Himalaya app or wherever you listen to podcasts. 
On the 'heartbreaking' cancelation of! Love You, America 
"It came as a surprise. We were so sure we were getting picked up. We're all super bummed about it. I 
know that they did love the show, but I think what it cost compared to its popularity or the eyes that 
they had on it didn't___you know, the people that make the decisions there don't have any connection to 
the show. And it is just so heartbreaking because I kind of feel cut off at the knees." 
Sarah Silverman on 'The Last Laugh' 
Cassandra Church/Starburns Audio 
On the 'bullshit' allegations against Al Franken 
"I can only just be honest and say, if I didn't know Al Franken, I'd probably be like yeah, go girl, me 
too, fuck that shit. Because I do know him, I don't feel that way. So maybe I'm too close to it and just 
seeing the dots not the big picture. But I just can't believe it. The U.S.O. thing is bullshit and if you 
watch the sketch they did, give me a fucking break. He may be guilty of doing pedestrian comedy, I 
guess, but he apologized and she accepted his apology. But it does seem that the Republican Party 
and I don't think this is something to emulate at all___doesn't apologize, denies everything, admits 
nothing and everyone keeps their job. And I hate that that's what we teach our children. But if you 
apologize and say, 'I want there to be an ethics investigation on me and I want to do everything by the 
book, this is my truth but I'm open to [the fact] that these women felt this way, I want to make this 
right,' I don't know why that person then loses their job."

GIVING THANKS 
Why Sarah Silverman Is 'Thankful' for Trump 
Matt Wilstein  
On looking like an 'asshole' after commenting on Louis C.K. 
"My experience with Louis as a teenager perhaps informs his pathology a bit. But in no way is it 
analogous to crimes, to assaults, he subsequently committed that mirror it, that come from it. I was just 
speaking about my own experience. And the headline was, 'He jerked off in front of me and I didn't 
care.' And that's so cold and insulting and awful to the women who were hurt by his actions. So if you 
clicked on it, they quoted me. But if you didn't, and nobody does, it just makes me look like an asshole. 
And me looking like an asshole is the least of it. It hurt people and there was stuff that I said that I 
don't think I was articulating the spirit of what I meant."

Seth Meyers Proves Trump Is the Real 'Husband From Hell' 
"It's such an '80s comedienne premise, but then it was also my truth so I was trying to reconcile with 
it. It's hard to not be meta about it, because just to say 'I'm single' on stage. There's something that 
feels so inherently hacky about it that I feel like I have these guilt pangs and then it just becomes a 
whole other bit. It's always weird to navigate. I've always been in relationships for big chunks of time 
and every time I come out I'm like a generation older and I don't know what my station is."

WASHINGTON — Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro is deriding President Donald Trump as foolish for 
trying to oust him. Kim Jong Un is testing Trump's "love" — and his resolve — in the North Korea negotiations. 
And Iran's leaders are finding new ways to threaten the U.S. and to defy the president's "maximum pressure" 
campaign.

Linda W. Grossman 
REMEMBERING CAVALIER MAGAZINE 
; Mrisman02 
LAUNCHING A MAGAZINE 
My friend Michael Simmons, who has been the editor of National Lampoon and High 
Times, observes that cavalier hired fine scribes. A few examples: Thomas Pynchon, Philip Roth, 
William Saroyman, Isaac Asimov, Theodore Sturgeon. Cavalier was launched by Fawcett 
Publications in 1952. 
Men's magazine Cavalier (motto: "For the American Male") was published the year 
before Playboy to whom it has often been compared, and back in the day tried to be seen as 
slightly hipper, more youthful and considered a bit more clever than its big name rival. Almost 
an anti-establishment Playboy. A slogan stated: "Your dad bought Playboy, you 
bought Cavalier." 
I BECAME A COLUMNIST 
I was invited to write a column, named "The Naked Emperor," for Cavalier, that was beginning 
to publish underground writers and artists. They paid me $1,000 a month. My first column was a 
report on an auction of two-inch squares from the hotel bedsheets slept on by the Beatles during 
their first trip to America. 
There were 300 screaming young girls, off on a fetishist's holiday. Obviously, there wouldn't be 
enough items to go around, but it was announced that the Beatles' unwashed towels and bed 
linens were to be cut into two-inch squares and sold for $1 each. The price included a notarized 
statement of authenticity. 
My second column was about Lenny Bruce___titled "Lenny the Lawyer," since he defended 
himself in trials He was arrested for obscene performances only because there were no blasphemy 
laws. I went to the bank and deposited my check, withdrawing half of it in cash, a $500 bill. 
Lenny was alone in his hotel room on Christmas Day when I presented it to him. And, with a 
large safety pin, Lenny attached the $500 bill to the outside breast pocket of his denim dungaree 
j acket. 
AFTER JFK ASSASSINATION 
In another column of mine, "Jack Ruby and His Dirty Little Secret," it began, "Lenny Bruce 
told me how all the night club comics used to Jack Ruby's "tattoo of a lady's schmutzik (translate: 
pussy) in his armpit." If it wasn't a fact, I was quite willing to settle for an apocryphal allusion 
which nevertheless crystallized the entire personality of that alleged murderer who wanted so 
very much to be liked. 
I say alleged because upon Ruby's own death. Dallas District Attorney Henry Wade said he 
would dismiss the murder charge against him, a promise which has since been kept, although no 
such posthumous grace was ever officially bestowed on Lee Harvey Oswald. See, they grant you 
retroactive innocence only in the face of innumerable witnesses who were present at the actual 
event through the miracle of inadvertent televised coverage. 
Now Jack Ruby's dirty little secret has been forever sealed away in his armpit by the hymen of 
history. Oh yeah, and at Lenny's funeral, that safety pin was still attached on his jacket. 
JULES SIEGEL 
Two years before Lenny's death, with his permission I published his obituary in my own 
magazine, The Realist. Before the issue went to press, he called his mother and a few others to 
let them know it would only be a hoax. The point was that he couldn't get work and his work was 
his life so he might as well be dead. And if people regretted that they hadn't helped him, well, 
now they could have a second chance because he was still alive. The obituary evoked inquiries 
from newspapers, wire services, foreign publications, radio and TV. 
"What's the meaning of it?" one editor asked me. "There's a lot of excitement at the city 
desk." 
"That is the meaning of it." 
A few years later, without my permission, Jules Siegel, the editor of a short-lived 
magazine, Cheetah, published a fake obituary of me. I thought it was funny. An Associated Press 
reporter called, and I explained that it was a hoax. 
"Are you sure?" he asked. 
"Of course. I would tell you if I was dead." 
Siegel started writing for cavalier. His first assignment was a profile of Sterling Hayden, an actor 
best known in Dr, Stranglove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb. 
Journalist Adam Ellsworth described Siegel's "Goodbye Surfing, Hello God" with his most 
famous example of rock journalism, but his most revolutionary was his article, "The Big Beat." 
It appeared in the Playboy-esque Cavalier magazine in 1965 and was one of the earliest writings 
he'd ever seen on the development of rock and roll, from slaves singing in chains on their way to 
America to Bob Dylan "going electric" at the Newport Folk Festival. 
Then Jules' friend, Arthur Kretchmer, became Cavalier's managing editor. "When the editorial 
director later resigned," Kretchmer said, "there was a 24-hour hiatus before the new editor 
arrived." Siegel and Kretchmer had been discussing the possibility of publishing an issue on rock 
and roll, so to make it happen, Kretchmer went into the office at night and retyped the magazine's 
schedule to include their ideas. 
When the new editorial started, Kretchmer handed him the schedules and said, "Here's what 
we're working on." The new editorial director suspected nothing and the rock and roll issue went 
ahead. Once the laughter died down, Jules talked for a good 25 minutes about 
some of the ups and downs of his writing career and how hard it is to make a 
living as any kind of a writer, let alone a "rock journalist." and the people who 
created it, seriously. 
Now everybody writes about rock and roll that way. Jules was one of the 
people who did it first. "Goodbye Surfing, Hello God!" is Jules's most famous 
example of rock journalism, but I think his most revolutionary is his article 
"The Big Beat." It appeared in the Playboy-esque Cavalier magazine in 1965 
and is one of the earliest writings I've ever seen on the development of rock 
and roll, from slaves singing in chains on their way to America to Bob Dylan 
"going electric" at the Newport Folk Festival. 
Jules Siegel died of a heart attack on November 17, 2012 at the age of 77. 
He was a brilliant author, but neither Rolling Stone nor the New York 
Times honored him with an obituary. Not even a fake one. 
COMIC STRIPS 
Art Spiegelman tells me his work at Cavalier 50 years ago: 
I was first invited into the mag to do two full-color comix pages in 1969 (when being printed in color 
was a Very Big Deal for me as was Getting Paid more than 25 bucks for a drawing), somehow in 
proximity to a big article on underground comix. It was around the time Vaughn Bode was made a 
regular contributor to the magazine, They were running some Crumb "Fritz the Cat" pages. All thanx 
to their hip, laid back and kind editor, Alan LeMond. 
I also did some gag cartoons, short strips and occasional illustrations for Cavalier (one especially 
bad drawing for a story by Bruce Jay Friedman, I recall). My work in 1969, as an apprentice 
underground cartoonist taking too many drugs was really, really awful so I'm grateful for the editor's 
hip and laid-back kindness. But, hey, I was proud to be in a mag that published pieces by Pynchon, 
Manny Farber and you. 
By the time I'd gotten incrementally better as a cartoonist in the first half of the 1970s I was regularly 
doing illustrations for soft-core fiction stories in Cavalier's low-rent sister 
mags, Dude, Gent and Nugget (even wrote a story or two there and got several of my San Francisco 
comix cronies (Spain Rodriguez, Bill Griffith and Justin Greene) illustration gigs with Alan for those 
mags as well.

[Note in Wikipedia: Maus is a graphic novel by American cartoonist Art Spiegelman, 
serialized from 1980 to 1991. It depicts Spiegelman interviewing his father about his experiences 
as a Polish Jew and Holocaust survivor. The work employs postmodemist techniques and 
represents Jews as mice, Germans as cats, and Poles as pigs. In 1992, Maus won a Pulitzer Prize.] 
COMIING AND GOING 
I wrote some movie reviews for Cavalier. I recall that Midnight Cowboy was 50 years ago. I 
always went to two screenings. The first one I would go stoned with magic mushrooms. The 
second one I took notes. However, I got fired by Cavalier. 
They declined to publish a particular column--my review of MASH as though it were a Busby 
Berkeley musical called Gook Killers of 1970-- ostensibly on the grounds of bad taste, but I 
learned that three wholesalers had told the publisher they were pressured by the FBI and would 
refuse to distribute Cavalier if my name appeared in it. 
On top of that, my name was on a list of sixty-five "radical" campus speakers, released by the 
House Internal Security Committee. The blacklist was published in the New York Times, and 
picked up by newspapers across the country. It might have been a coincidence, but my campus-
speaking engagement-bookings stopped abruptly. It felt just like a film. 
OH, WELL 
It was over for me, but it had been fun___like the issue with only the one large red headline 
on the Cavalier cover: "BEAT 'EM SENSELESS FIRST"___THE FREE SPEECH 
CONTROVERSY, BY PAUL KRASSNER . . . "Ironically," I wrote, "it is this concept of the 
total education experience on campus which I believe to be the basic significance of the much-
misunderstood free-speech imbroglio at the University of California in Berkeley." 
The sit-in lasted till 3 a.m. Next day, October 1, 1964, ten tables were manned again, and 
a campus policeman approached one of the tables (manned by the Congress of Racial Equality) 
where a dozen persons were seated. One was singled out and placed under arrest. But before you 
could say nonviolent demonstration, the police car was surrounded, its captors reaching as many 
as 3,000 students. During the late evening, bored fraternity men gathered and tossed lighted 
cigarettes and eggs on those sitting in the plaza. The demonstrators responded with silence. 
Next day, 450 police assembled on campus to remove the cop car and its arrested inhabitant, 
but an agreement to negotiate was reached and the demonstrators dispersed. One of the folk songs 
to come out of the Free Speech Movement incidentally, was If I Negotiate With You, to the tune 
of the Beatles' If IFell in Love With You. 
Over the next couple of months there was a series of sit-ins and attempted negotiations, and 
then, on December 2, the infamous Sproul Hall sit-in. It took twelve hours for 800 students to be 
arrested by some 600 instructors of a new course called Introductory Police Brutality. These were 
from the lab notes student took. 
There was a freshman co-ed at Berkeley who___long after she had forgotten what some 
professor spouted during an official lecture about Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment___would 
remember, with perhaps a twinge of frightened pride, learning from a fellow demonstrator that if 
she planned to go limp when the police arrested her, it would be an act of practical feminine 
foresight to remove the earrings from her pierced lobes in advance. 
So, now in 2019, fighting over free speech has been happening heavily at Berkeley campus again. 
Meanwhile, Trump grabbed a pussy on the Statue of Liberty. Cavalier, anyone?

Given the risk of further restrictive trade measures, we answer investors' top questions. We expect 
shares to remain choppy, with a near-term floor around $160. Our estimates are unchanged but 
peer multiple contraction drives our SoTP-driven PT to $231 (from $240). 
What is the latest view on iPhone demand in China? On Apple's April 30th earnings call, CEO Tim 
Cook noted that the November-December period was likely to be the trough in iPhone demand in 
China, following an improvement in performance during the March quarter helped by iPhone price 
cuts, VAT tax rollbacks, increased financing options and better consumer confidence. Data from 
push-messaging service provider Jigaung shows that the improvement in iPhone demand likely 
persisted through April, where Apple gained over 175bps of Chinese smartphone installed base 
share Y/Y (1). However, the increasingly tough trade rhetoric and actions recently taken by US and 
Chinese authorities make it less likely this trend will continue into May/June. Late last week, 
following the Huawei blacklist, President Trump commented that "it's possible that Huawei would be 
________included in a trade deal", suggesting recent actions could be bargaining chips to use in trade 
negotiations that can be worked out by/around the G20 Summit in late June, but with Apple guiding 
June quarter revenue down 8% Q/Q (vs. trailing 3 year seasonality of -14% Q/Q), the risk remains 
that weaker near-term demand in China increases the risk of a revenue shortfall. For reference, we 
model 37M iPhone shipments in the June quarter (-10% Y/Y), in-line with iPhone builds, which 
implies a 5th consecutive quarter of double digit iPhone shipment declines in China. If we assume 
Chinese demand significantly weakens in the last 6 weeks of the quarter and iPhone shipments 
instead fall 50% Y/Y (a 10 point further deceleration from March Q declines), then we'd expect 2.3M 
lower iPhone units (-6% vs. our current model), $1.6B lower revenue (-2.9%) and a $0.05 hit to EPS

Is UNRWA vital for the Palestinians' future? 
A great international hue and cry followed the 
Trump administration's announcement the 
U.S. would no longer fund the UN Relief and  
Works Agency (UNWRA) because it is an 
"irredeemably flawed operation." Historically, 
the United States was the organization's 
biggest funder — in 2017, the U.S. covered 
nearly one-third of the agency's budget of $1.1 
billion. Angered by the Palestinians' refusal to

restart peace talks with Israel, however, the administration cut its 
contribution in early 2018 from $364 million to $60 million before 
ceasing payments altogether.

How Obama Blew the Chance for Economic Peace 
by Mitchell Bard 
Iln 2009, Barack Obama had an 
unprecedented opportunity to advance the 
peace process between Israel and the 
Palestinians. For the first time, the 
Palestinians had a prime minister who was 
respected and admired by the Israelis, 
because he did not come from the same 
terrorist background as Yasser Arafat and 
Mahmoud Abbas. Unlike his ideological 
comrades who insisted on "liberating Palestine," Salam Fayyad, was 
interested in building the infrastructure for a future state, 
strengthening the West Bank economy, and improving the lives of the 
Palestinian people.

Last Survivor of Sobibor Uprising Dies 
On June 3, 2019, Semyon Rosenfeld, the last living Holocaust 
survivor who participated in the revolt and escape from the Sobibor 
death camp, died at the age of 97 in Israel. Rosenfeld joined the Red 
Army in 1940. While he was fighting the Germans, his family was 
killed by the Nazis. He was captured by the Germans in 1941 and, 
two years later, he was transferred to Sobibor. Rosenfeld escaped 
during the revolt and survived by hiding in the woods until 1944. He 
then rejoined the Red Army and participated in the capture of Berlin.

Views on Israel of U.S. Presidential Candidates 2020:  
Joe Biden  
Former Vice President Joseph Robinette Biden, Jr., was born 
November 20, 1942, in Scranton, Pennsylvania, the first of four 
siblings. In 1953, the Biden family moved from Pennsylvania to 
Claymont, Delaware. He graduated from the University of Delaware 
and Syracuse Law School. 
One of his first overseas visits as a senator was to Israel, on the eve 
of the 1973 Yom Kippur War during which he met GoIda Meir. "She 
read letters and told me how this young man or woman had died and 
this is their family. This went on for I don't know how long, and I guess 
she could tell I was visibly moved by this, and I was getting depressed 
about it." The Prime Minister said, "Senator, don't look so sad... .we 
have a secret weapon in our confrontation in this part of the world. 
And I thought she was about to lean over and tell me about a new 
system or something... .she said, our secret weapon, Senator, is we 
have no place else to go. We have no place else to go."

Subject: Trump financial disclosure 
Importance: High 
Catching up on some reading and finally read trumps 100 pages of nonsense. Some interesting findings: 
1) foundation is inactive 
2) ironic that starett city largest federal subsidized housing project which trump had 4 percent interest was 
finally sold while he is president. 
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bizjournals.com/newyork/news/2018/05/09/starrett-city-sells-giving-
trump-a-profit.amp.html  
3) other than doral and post office hotel no substantial income from any of his enties that he showed.. 
4) 30 pages of stock purchases and sales all 5-15k. 
5) cash in his name 25mm or less 
6) still has money in revocable trust from his father at jpm 1-5mm 
7) claims to have as much as 125mm in trump revocable trust at cap one, professional bank, signature bank and 
bank United but can be as little as 40mm it mins were real numbers. 
Didn't he once say he say he had billions of liquidity.. 
8) valued planes from 56 to over 86mm. Down from 300mm on earlier disclosures.. 
9) Bank used for last mortgage on ocean drive purchase is a coral gables bank that is opening in boca as well.

Importance: High 
Hope you are satisfied with the outcome all things considered. 
Ridiculous article. All of sudden the NPA in 's case goes from no 
jurisdiction even to prosecute to you avoiding a possible life 
sentence. Moronic. 
Man I sure would like to see you getting some in the W column though and 
some press that at least presents the true facts that some of the girls have 
admitted under oath. Still a story no one ever has heard and they are 
compelling facts. 
Good Shabbos. 
The numerous young women who say they were sexually abused by 
wealthy, Clinton-linked financier Jeffrey Epstein no longer appear set to 
testify after a last-minute settlement was reached in a closely-watched civil 
lawsuit against the registered sex offender.

Did the British promise the Arabs independence in 
Palestine? 
In July 1915, Hussein ibn 'Ali, the Sherif of 
Mecca, sent a letter to Sir Henry MacMahon, 
the High Commissioner for Egypt, informing 
him of the terms for Arab participation in the 
war against the Turks. The letters between 
Hussein and Mac-Mahon that followed outlined 
the areas that Britain was prepared to cede to 
the Arabs in exchange for their help.

Trump's Saudi Arms Sale Is About Politics and 
Economics, Not Security 
by Mitchell Bard 
President Trump wants to use his emergency 
powers to sell billions of dollars' worth of 
weapons to Saudi Arabia on national security 
grounds. Congress wants to stop the sale 
because of lingering anger over Saudi abuses 
and the murder of journalist Jamal 
Khashoggi, and the usurpation of its legal 
authority to review arms sales. Both sides are 
ingenuous. The willingness to sell the Saudis - 
weapons has little to do with American national security, and 
everything to do with economics and politics.

Arizona-Israel Cooperation 
The U.S.-Israel relationship is based on the twin pillars of shared 
values and mutual interests. Given this commonality of interests and 
beliefs, it should not be surprising that support for Israel is one of the 
most pronounced and consistent foreign policy values of the American 
people. 
Today's interdependent global economy requires that trade policy be 
developed at the national and state level. Many states have 
recognized the opportunity for realizing significant benefits by seeking 
to increase trade with Israel. Arizona is one of 33 states that have 
cooperative agreements with Israel.

Amy Klobuchar 
Amy Jean Klobuchar* was born on May 25, 1960, in Plymouth, 
Minnesota. Klobuchar is the daughter of Rose (née Heuberger) and 
Jim Klobuchar. She has one younger sister. Her parents divorced 
when Klobuchar was 15. 
Klobuchar attended public schools in Plymouth and was valedictorian 
at Wayzata High School. In 1982, she graduated from Yale magna 
cum laude with a B.A. in political science. During college, she was a

improv troupe Suddenly Susan. During her time at Yale, Klobuchar 
spent time as an intern for then Vice President, and former Minnesota 
Senator, Walter Mondale. Her senior thesis was "Uncovering the 
Dome," a history of the ten years of politics surrounding the building of 
the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in Minneapolis.

<h5>Operation Chaos Lives By Paul Krassner If a psychologist testing you in a free association method said “Vietnam War deserters” you most likely would reply “Canada.” However, Matthew Sweet, the British author of Operation Chaos: The Vietnam Deserters Who Fought the CIA, the Brainwashers, and Themselves, would definitely respond “Stockholm,” as proven by his nonfiction book’s comprehensive research. By 1968, more than a thousand deserters and draft resisters had escaped to Sweden.                                                                                                                           Many of them formed a group named the American Deserters Committee.  That ADC might just as well have served it as insane inadvertently satire. For example, a few friends kept a woman in her in her apartment, playing Beethoven in an attempt to reprogram her brain. An individual insisted that the Beatles were created as an instrument of psychological warfare. And the author himself became to believe the genocidal ambitions of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth’s secret plot to start World War III. And now, for whatever purpose, Donald Trump has met the same Majesty Queen Elizabeth.

The American CIA was then to be performed at a secret facility near Stockholm, where Marcus explained how brainwashed candidates were hypnotized, subjected to electric shocks, forced to eat their own excrement, endure sexual humiliation, and tortured until they whined like puppies.

And that was then I knew I’d been swallowed by my own story. Swallowed, but not brainwashed.” He’s still alive.      Back in New York, at the National Caucus of Labor Committees, Marcus was the leader of Students for a Democratic Society. For better or worse, he was delivering a charismatic economics lecture to an enthusiastic SDS crowd.

And yes, Lyndon LaRouche decided to drop his alias into pure manure.      He was an unlovable conspiracy theorist who ran for the U.S. presidency eight times. He played himself as a cartoon character in an episode of The Simpsons in which aliens kidnapped presidential candidates Bill Clinton and Bob Dole, Immersing them in tanks of bubbling pink liquid. Homer shouted, “Oh my God! Lyndon LaRouche was right!” And Saturday Night Live featured “Lyndon LaRouche Theater,” in which Randy Quaid played LaRouche, with a bald wig, bow-tie and spectacles, narrating melodramatic twists, conspiracies, and confessing “I am insane.” *    *    *      Not mentioned in the book, near the end of March 1981, I delivered a keynote address at the Youth International Party convention in New York. These were the latterday Yippies, originally launched as the anti-Yippie “Zippies” during the 1972 both conventions in Miami. I asked the audience a rhetorical question, “How would you like to be a Secret Service agent guarding Ronald Reagan, knowing that his vice president, George Bush, is the former head of the CIA?”      Once again, satire would be outdistanced by reality. On March 30, the president was shot by John Hinckley in order to make a favorable impression on actress Jodie Foster so that he could take her bowling on a date.

The meeting convened by the Yippie organization, featured former Playboy editor Paul Krassner and numerous individuals associated with High Times magazine, Hustler magazine and the Chicago Sun-Times.      In a statement this afternoon, national Democratic Policy Committee advisory board chairman Lyndon LaRouche urged that this information be made public at this time as a means of assisting government investigators pursuing the assassination attempt against President Reagan.

Operation Chaos Lives
By Paul Krassner
If a psychologist testing you in a free association method said “Vietnam War deserters” you most likely would reply “Canada.” However, Matthew Sweet, the British author of Operation Chaos: The Vietnam Deserters Who Fought the CIA, the Brainwashers, and Themselves, would definitely respond “Stockholm,” as proven by his nonfiction book’s comprehensive research. By 1968, more than a thousand deserters and draft resisters had escaped to Sweden.                                                                                                                     
     Many of them formed a group named the American Deserters Committee.  That ADC might just as well have served it as insane inadvertently satire. For example, a few friends kept a woman in her in her apartment, playing Beethoven in an attempt to reprogram her brain. An individual insisted that the Beatles were created as an instrument of psychological warfare. And the author himself became to believe the genocidal ambitions of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth’s secret plot to start World War III. And now, for whatever purpose, Donald Trump has met the same Majesty Queen Elizabeth.                                     
     Back In January 1974, journalists and activists whistle-blowers revealed the truth that there was a takeover by the CIA of the United States.

Trump calls Stormy Daniels 'Horseface' 
Jordan Fabian 
1 hr ago 
0 Photo by Gabe Ginsberg/Getty Images Stormy Daniels hit back with an insult of her own after President 
Trump called her "Horseface." President Trump on Tuesday called adult-film star Stormy Daniels "Horseface" 
and threatened to "go after" her after he won a court victory over his alleged mistress. 
"Federal Judge throws out Stormy DaniaIs [sic] lawsuit versus Trump. Trump is entitled to full legal fees.' 
@FoxNews Great, now I can go after Horseface and her 3rd rate lawyer in the Great State of Texas. She will 
confirm the letter she signed! She knows nothing about me, a total con!' he tweeted. 
The tweet comes one day after a federal judge in California threw out Daniels's defamation lawsuit against 
Trump and ordered Daniels to repay the president's legal fees. 
Daniels's attorney, Michael Avenatti, responded by calling Trump a "disgusting misogynist" and a "liar" who 
has dishonored his family and country. 
"You are a disgusting misogynist and an embarrassment to the United States. Bring everything you have, 
because we are going to demonstrate to the world what a complete shyster and liar you are. How many other 
women did you cheat on your wife with while you had a baby at home?" he tweeted.

<h5>EXTORTION – AVANATTI    How Avenatti May Have Crossed The Line Into Extortion        By Andrew Strickler     Share us on: By Andrew Strickler     Law360 (March 26, 2019, 9:52 PM EDT) -- A day after being accused of trying to extort Nike, attorney and President Donald Trump antagonist Michael Avenatti was on the offensive Tuesday with allegations of corruption on the part of the company, but those counterpunches likely won't help him dodge federal charges that he went beyond hardball advocacy.  According to prosecutors, Avenatti pressed Nike to pay him millions of dollars as an "internal investigator" in addition to the much smaller figure he demanded from the sports gear giant for his youth basketball coach client.  The lack of nexus between his client's alleged injury at Nike's hands and Avenatti's demand for eight-figure fees as an investigator puts the allegations well beyond the realm of aggressive posturing and into the parameters of federal extortion statutes, said criminal defense attorney Jeremy Saland of Crotty Saland PC.  "Being a blowhard is not illegal, but whether what he's claiming Nike did is fact or fiction doesn't justify trying to enrich himself with a job that doesn't help remedy a wrong suffered by a client," Saland said.  On Monday, federal officials in New York arrested Avenatti, charging the pugnacious Los Angeles lawyer with threatening Nike with a stock-price-sinking press conference about recruitment misconduct if it didn't pay up.  Avenatti, who purported to be representing the coach of a youth basketball team once sponsored by Nike, demanded $1.5 million for the client, who had recently seen Nike drop its support, according to the charges. Separately, Avenatti and another attorney — an unnamed co-conspirator since identified as celebrity defense attorney Mark Geragos — also demanded Nike hire them to conduct an "internal investigation" related to amateur player recruiting.

EXTORTION – AVANATTI



How Avenatti May Have Crossed The Line Into Extortion







By Andrew Strickler 



Share us on: By Andrew Strickler 



Law360 (March 26, 2019, 9:52 PM EDT) -- A day after being accused of trying to extort Nike, attorney and President Donald Trump antagonist Michael Avenatti was on the offensive Tuesday with allegations of corruption on the part of the company, but those counterpunches likely won't help him dodge federal charges that he went beyond hardball advocacy.

According to prosecutors, Avenatti pressed Nike to pay him millions of dollars as an "internal investigator" in addition to the much smaller figure he demanded from the sports gear giant for his youth basketball coach client.

The lack of nexus between his client's alleged injury at Nike's hands and Avenatti's demand for eight-figure fees as an investigator puts the allegations well beyond the realm of aggressive posturing and into the parameters of federal extortion statutes, said criminal defense attorney Jeremy Saland of Crotty Saland PC.

"Being a blowhard is not illegal, but whether what he's claiming Nike did is fact or fiction doesn't justify trying to enrich himself with a job that doesn't help remedy a wrong suffered by a client," Saland said.

On Monday, federal officials in New York arrested Avenatti, charging the pugnacious Los Angeles lawyer with threatening Nike with a stock-price-sinking press conference about recruitment misconduct if it didn't pay up.

Avenatti, who purported to be representing the coach of a youth basketball team once sponsored by Nike, demanded $1.5 million for the client, who had recently seen Nike drop its support, according to the charges. Separately, Avenatti and another attorney — an unnamed co-conspirator since identified as celebrity defense attorney Mark Geragos — also demanded Nike hire them to conduct an "internal investigation" related to amateur player recruiting.

The cost: at least $12 million and as much as $25 million. Prosecutors said Avenatti was also recorded at a March 21 meeting with Nike lawyers at Boies Schiller Flexner LLP offering to end the entire matter, with no bad publicity for Nike, for $22.5 million.

If the company didn't agree, Avenatti threatened an immediate press conference amid the NCAA basketball tournament about Nike making payments to youth players and their families, prosecutors said, an event he promised would snowball into more bad press and people coming forward with claims of recruiting malfeasance.

In a recorded phone call, Avenatti told Nike attorneys that if the company tried to negotiate a cap on the investigation fees, he would go public and "take a billion dollars off your client's market cap," according to the complaint. At a March 21 meeting in New York, Avenatti allegedly continued to wield threats and press for the investigator role, at one point asking Nike attorneys if they'd ever had "the balls of a client in [their] hands."

"Michael Avenatti may be the best lawyer in the world, according to Michael Avenatti, but there are appropriate courses of conduct to address an alleged wrongdoing, and I don't see how a demand of, 'Give me a job and pay me $12 million,' is ever going to make the client whole," Saland said.

Adam Felsenstein, a white collar defense specialist at Gallet Dreyer &amp; Berkey LLP, called the prosecutor's narrative "very extortive," particularly on the allegation regarding Avenatti's demand to be hired directly by the company. If that element of the charges is well-founded, it would effectively leave Avenatti without a "cloak of legitimacy" that he was acting solely to resolve a dispute on behalf of his client.

The complaint "doesn't even refer to anticipated litigation. It's just, 'I'm going to reveal embarrassing information unless you pay me.' And once you start asking for money for yourself like that, you trend into extortion," Felsenstein said.

Barry Temkin of Mound Cotton Wollan &amp; Greengrass LLP similarly characterized the alleged scheme as "brazen," and voiced doubt Avenatti would be able to argue that he could pressure Nike to hire him as an investigator and stay within the legal lines.

A Nike spokesperson on Tuesday referred to a company statement that it has been cooperating with a government investigation into NCAA basketball for more than a year, and would not "be extorted or hide information" relevant to that probe.

The case is U.S. v. Avenatti, case number 19-mj-2927, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.

Henry Paulson, Ben Bernanke and Timothy Geithner in the documentary "Inside Job." 
Sony Pictures Classics 
Who Maimed the Economy, and How 
By A. 0. SCOTT 
"Inside Job," a sleek, briskly paced film whose title suggests a heist movie, is the story of a crime without 
punishment, of an outrage that has so far largely escaped legal sanction and societal stigma. The betrayal 
of public trust and collective values that Mr. Ferguson chronicles was far more brazen and damaging than 
the adultery in Nathaniel Hawthorne's novel, which treated Hester more as scapegoat than villain. 
The gist of this movie, which begins in a mood of calm reflection and grows angrier and more incredulous 
as it goes on, is unmistakably punitive. The density of information and the complexity of the subject 
matter make "Inside Job" feel like a classroom lecture at times, but by the end Mr. Ferguson has 
summoned the scourging moral force of a pulpit-shaking sermon. That he delivers it with rigor, restraint 
and good humor makes his case all the more devastating. 
He is hardly alone in making it. Numerous journalists have published books and articles retracing the 
paths that led the world economy to the precipice two years ago. The deregulation of the financial 
services industry in the 1980s and '9os; the growing popularity of complex and risky derivatives; the real 
estate bubble and the explosion of subprime lending — none of these developments were exactly secret. 
On the contrary, they were celebrated as vindications of the power and wisdom of markets. Accordingly, 
Mr. Ferguson recycles choice moments of triumphalism, courtesy of Lawrence H. Summers, George W.  
Bush, Alan Greenspan and various cable television ranters and squawkers. 
Even as stock indexes soared and profits swelled, there were always at least a few investors, economists 
and government officials who warned that the frenzied speculation was leading to the abyss. Some of 
these prophets without honor show up in front of Mr. Ferguson's camera, less to gloat than to present, 
once again, the analyses that were dismissed and ignored by their peers for so long. 
Dozens of interviews — along with news clips and arresting aerial shots of New York, Iceland and other 
disaster areas — are folded into a clear and absorbing history, narrated by Matt Damon. The music (an 
opening song, "Big Time," by Peter Gabriel, and a score by Alex Heffes) and the clean wide-screen 
cinematography provide an aesthetic polish that is welcome for its own sake and also important to the 
movie's themes. The handsomely lighted and appointed interiors convey a sense of the rarefied, 
privileged worlds in which the Wall Street operators and their political enablers flourished, and the 
elegance of the presentation also subliminally bolsters the film's authority. This is not a piece of ragged 
muckraking or breathless advocacy. It rests its outrage on reason, research and careful argument. 
The same was true of Mr. Ferguson's previous documentary, "No End in Sight," which focused on 
catastrophic policies carried out in Iraq by President George W. Bush's administration just after the 
overthrow of Saddam Hussein. But whereas that film concentrated on a narrow view of a complex subject 
— the conduct of the war rather than the at least equally controversial rationale for fighting it — "Inside 
Job" offers a sweeping synthesis, going as far back as the Reagan administration and as far afield as 
Iceland in its anatomy of the financial crisis. 
Perhaps unsurprisingly, many of the highest-profile players declined to be interviewed. Mr. Summers 
appears only in news footage, and none of his predecessors or successors as Treasury secretary — not 
Robert E. Rubin or Henry M. Paulson Jr. or Timothy F. Geithner — submit to Mr. Ferguson's questions. 
Nor do any of the top executives at Goldman Sachs or the other big banks. Most of the interviewees are, 
at least from the perspective of the filmmaker, friendly witnesses, adding fuel to the director's 
comprehensive critique of the way business has been done in the United States and the other advanced 
capitalist countries for the past two decades. 
Both American political parties are indicted; "Inside Job" is not simply another belated settling of 
accounts with Mr. Bush and his advisers, though they are hardly ignored. The scaling back of government 
oversight and the weakening of checks on speculative activity by banks began under Reagan and 
continued during the Clinton administration. And with each administration the market in derivatives 
expanded, and alarms about the dangers of this type of investment were ignored. Raghuram Raj an, chief 
economist at the International Monetary Fund, presented a paper in 2005 warning of a "catastrophic 
meltdown" and was mocked as a "Luddite" by Mr. Summers. 
Meanwhile, some investment bankers — at Goldman Sachs in particular — were betting against the 
positions they were pushing on their customers. An elaborate house of cards had been constructed in 
which bad consumer loans were bundled into securities, which, were certified as sound by rating agencies 
paid by the banks and then insured via credit-default swaps. One risky bet was stacked on top of another, 
and in retrospect the collapse of the whole edifice, along with the loss of jobs, homes, pensions and 
political confidence, seems inevitable. 
How did this happen? Mr. Ferguson is no conspiracy theorist; nor is he inclined toward structural or 
systemic explanations. Markets are not like tectonic plates, shifting on their own. Visible hands write laws 
and make deals, and in this case a combination of warped values and groupthink seems to have driven 
very intelligent men (and they were mostly men) toward folly. In addition to business and government, 
Mr. Ferguson aims his critique at academia, suggesting that the discipline of economics and more than a 
few prominent economists were corrupted by consulting fees, seats on boards of directors and 
membership in the masters of the universe club. 
When he challenges some of these professors, in particular those who held positions of responsibility in 
the White House or in the Federal Reserve, they are reduced to stammering obfuscation — Markets are 
complicated! Who could have predicted? I don't see any conflict of interest — and occasionally provoked 
to testiness. Mr. Ferguson, for his part, cannot always contain his incredulity or rein in his sarcasm. 
Occasionally his voice pipes up from off camera, saying things like, "You can't be serious!" 
But it is hard to imagine a movie more serious, and more urgent, than "Inside Job." There are a few 
avenues that might have been explored more thoroughly, in particular the effects of the crisis on 
ordinary, non-Wall-Street-connected workers and homeowners. The end of the film raises a disturbing 
question, as Mr. Damon exhorts viewers to demand changes in the status quo so that the trends 
associated with unchecked speculation of the kind that caused the last crisis — rising inequality, neglect 
of productive capacity, endless cycles of boom and bust — might be reversed. 
This call to arms makes you wonder why anger of the kind so eloquently expressed in "Inside Job" has 
been so inchoate. And through no fault of its own, the film may leave you dispirited as well as enraged. Its 
fate is likely to be that of other documentaries: praised in some quarters, nitpicked in others and 
shrugged off by those who need its message most. Which is a shame. 
"Inside Job" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Some drug and sex references and pervasive 
obscenity, though not the verbal kind.

The Weekly Standard   The Illusion of Peace with Syria   Elliott Abrams      May 23, 2011 -- The news from Syria grows grimmer by the day—more peaceful protesters killed, ten thousand arrested in the past week, army units shelling residential neighborhoods.    But the Obama administration’s response has not grown grimmer or louder. As recently as May 6, Secretary of State Clinton was still talking about a “reform agenda” in Syria, as if Bashar al-Assad were a slightly misguided bureaucrat rather than the murderer of roughly 1,000 unarmed demonstrators. As for the president, though the White House has issued a couple of statements in his name, he has yet to say one word on camera about the bloodletting in Syria. This is not a small matter, for a tough statement attacking the regime’s repression and giving the demonstrators moral support would immediately circulate over the Internet. American sanctions against Syria, meanwhile, have not named Assad, and there has been no call for him to step down.   Why is the administration appearing to stick with Assad and refusing to call for his ouster? A key reason may be the hope that an Israeli-Syrian peace deal can be arranged.    From the day it came to office, the Obama administration clearly wanted to win an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement. There has been no progress during its two years in office, mostly because the White House insisted on a 100 percent construction freeze in the West Bank settlements and Jerusalem as a precondition for negotiations. This was politically impossible in Israel, and also meant that Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas could not come to the table lest he appear to be asking less from Israel than the Americans.   With negotiations frozen, the Palestinians turned to unilateral measures: seeking a United Nations vote admitting the State of Palestine to membership and getting dozens of countries to recognize a Palestinian state. Meanwhile, their delegitimization campaign against Israel continued apace, especially in Europe, where calls for boycotts and sanctions spread. On the pro-Israel side there was also consideration of unilateral measures—steps to head off the Palestinians diplomatically (several of which I described and supported in the April 11 Weekly Standard).   Some forlorn hope may still have existed inside the administration that a compromise on construction could bring the Palestinians back to the table with the government of Israel—until the agreement between Hamas and Fatah was signed on April 27. This agreement, unless and until it collapses, makes Israeli concessions or new flexibility in the West Bank impossible and puts paid to the entire “peace process.” It brings Hamas into the Palestinian Authority government, ending a period of several years when Palestinian Security Forces have cooperated with the Israel Defense Forces against terrorism and against Hamas in particular. It will also bring Hamas—next year and for the first time—into the PLO, the body charged with negotiating peace with Israel. Even Yasser Arafat resisted that development when he headed the PLO, and it seems obvious that Israel cannot negotiate peace with an anti-Semitic terrorist group bent on its destruction.   So where can the White House turn if it wants some kind of peace process in the Middle East? Syria. After all, in his first term as prime minister, back in 1998, Benjamin Netanyahu did authorize indirect negotiations with Syria. And the IDF—and especially Ehud Barak, a former head of the IDF, Israel’s defense minister, and a close adviser to Netanyahu—has long favored such a deal. The IDF theory was that if Syria made peace, so would Lebanon, and then Israel would be at peace with all four neighboring Arab states. And it can be argued now that Assad may see negotiations with Israel as a way to climb back from the pariah status he is earning, making him at this juncture truly open to a new peace process.   Such thinking, whether in Jerusalem or the White House, is foolish and even grotesque. There is no possibility that Assad would negotiate seriously and that an agreement could be attained. He is now clinging desperately to power, and his only true allies are Iran and Hezbollah. Yet Israel’s (and, one hopes, our own) key precondition to any agreement would necessarily be a clean break in those relationships: an end to the Syrian alliance with Hezbollah and Iran. Otherwise Israel would be giving the Golan, in effect, to Iran—a suicidal act. No Israeli government would do it, which suggests that negotiations with Assad would have no purpose.   Assad may indeed be open to commencing a negotiation as a means to escape international isolation, but that’s all the more reason not to give it to him. Prime Minister Ehud Olmert’s 2008 talks with Syria (via Turkey) allowed Syria to escape the partial isolation the United States had imposed on it in that decade, with zero gain for Israel. This is not an experiment worth repeating, for the Assad regime is today even more despicable than it was three years ago.   To react to the murders now taking place all over Syria by embracing the Assad regime would be morally indefensible. Whether Assad can be overthrown soon by the people of Syria is a fair question to ask. Will the army stay with him, or will Sunni units rebel? Will the Sunni business elites turn against him? How long can the regime survive? We do not yet know the answers. But surely we must avoid any step that could help Assad, rehabilitate his regime, or undermine the courageous struggle of peaceful demonstrators in the streets of Syria.    The peace agreements that Israel signed with Egypt and Jordan were real achievements, but there will be no such agreements with the Palestinians or with Syria in the foreseeable future. The Palestinians have taken themselves out of the game for now. We cannot turn from them to the Syrians while Assad’s troops are using howitzers and sniper rifles against his people. This is the time not for diplomatic engagement with Assad, but for diplomacy aimed at quarantining his regime and helping bring it down. The White House should dismiss any remaining dreams of a “peace process” with Syria to substitute for the Palestinian version and face facts: There will be no peace with the butcher who rules Syria today.

The Daily Star   A democratic Arab world would welcome peace with Israel Hamid Alkifaey  One could reasonably argue that the golden opportunity for peace in the Middle East was blown away when Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated on Nov. 4, 1995.  He was the only Israeli leader capable of making peace with the Palestinians, and was about to do so had it not been for the bullets of Yigal Amir, the right-wing religious zealot who believed in the “winner takes all” principle.  One could also claim that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and its global ramifications are responsible for agitating religious extremism in the Muslim world as a whole, and among Palestinians in particular. Prior to 1987, there was hardly any Islamic factor in Palestinian resistance. The Hamas and Islamic Jihad groups were established after the 1987 intifada. From this we deduce that extremism on the Israeli side led to the same on the Palestinian side, and consequently in other Muslim countries, which manifests in popular opposition to traditional and despotic regimes. The Arab world is currently going through a social and political revolution that has so far claimed two “entrenched” regimes in Tunisia and Egypt. At least three other regimes in the region are fighting for their lives, and are not expected to survive. There will soon be different styles of government in Libya, Yemen and Syria. This much is certain.  Will there be a different policy toward Israel? Certainly. But this will take time to take shape, since there are more pressing national priorities, such as political and economic reforms. Israel has long branded the Arab world as tribal and undemocratic, in order to brand itself the only democracy in the Middle East. Well, soon enough it won’t be. Many of its neighbors will soon join the democratic world as demands for democracy grow. Democracy will mean more development, prosperity and people’s power. It means more popular participation in decision making and awareness of the possibilities of the nation and what it can and cannot do. It may not mean more hostility toward Israel if the latter knows how to deal with it. But there will be tension if Israel continues to follow extreme policies, which it will under the current leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu.  The Palestinians must achieve their right to establish their own state on their land. This right has been recognized by almost everyone except a minority of extremists in Israel, led by Netanyahu. Free and democratic Arab countries won’t shrink from supporting this Palestinian right under any circumstances. Muslims will not give up on East Jerusalem, either. Arab regimes have been weak in the past. Democracy will strengthen them, but also add reason to Arab governance. Most Arabs have accepted Israel’s right to exist, and accepted U.N. resolutions 242 and 338, but Israeli intransigence is not helping them formulate a unified position.  Democratic Egypt won’t be a threat to Israel as the Egyptian military, which will continue to be highly influential in Egypt’s politics in the foreseeable future, will not risk another war with Israel. Egyptians under a democratic regime will be seeking better living standards, better laws to govern the country and more rights as citizens. They won’t be pressing their government to fight Israel; on the contrary, they want a stable economy where things will be better for future generations. But Israel may aggravate the situation by electing extremists and following extreme policies. This will strengthen the hands of the hawks in the Arab world. Moderate Israel under reasonable and realistic leaders should have nothing to fear from Egypt, with which it has an enduring peace treaty.  The situation with Syria may not be exactly the same, however, especially when the two countries are still officially in a state of war. The regime of Bashar Assad, and his father before him, would have never started a war with Israel unilaterally. It also suited them not to have a peace treaty. Any new Syrian leader is not likely (for a considerable period of time) to initiate a move toward a peace agreement with Israel as this will weaken his position domestically. Nor will he launch a war, however, since such a war will not result in victory. A democratic regime in Syria, or any other Arab country for that matter, will need a good 10 years to build democratic institutions and stabilize a modern market economy needed in any democracy. So, war won’t be on the agenda in the near future. Prosperity increases the public’s stake in a stable economy, and this will make people want to compromise to make their country more prosperous and stable. However, everything will depend on how prepared the free world is to help new democracies in the Middle East survive and prosper. Small Islamic groups, organized and armed with religious zeal, could hijack power from the moderates. This would lead to a disaster for the whole region. Therefore, it is imperative for the free world, Israel included, not to leave matters to chance.

The Daily Beast    The Awkward Exit of Mideast Envoy George Mitchell   Daniel Stone      May 13, 2011 -- Two days after Barack Obama's inauguration, George Mitchell was named special envoy for Middle East peace. With the new president standing beside Mitchell and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Vice President Joe Biden took the podium and extolled Mitchell's reputation and experience having brokered peace in Northern Ireland, calling him an "outstanding public servant" with "incredible capacity." In the press, Mitchell was praised as the right man for the job at the right time.   On Friday, though, that capacity had reached its limit, and Mitchell told his bosses in the West Wing that he'd had enough. His reasons, he said, were personal—the kind of nebulous rationale that leaves ample room for interpretation. Unmentioned were the months of frustration that Mitchell had built up as direct negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians became more difficult and the peace process further off.   The timing of Mitchell's departure couldn't be more awkward. Obama will meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Jordan's King Abdullah next week, as well as deliver a major speech on Middle East policy. But the resignation didn't come as a surprise to those who worked closest with Mitchell. A State Department official described to Newsweek a man increasingly annoyed by both parties' constant moving of the goal posts and the constraints of the administration's unshakeable political instinct to support Israel.   The strain was noticeable in the Middle East. In a recent interview with Newsweek, one senior Israeli official said Mitchell often would say one thing about the direction the U.S. was taking with the two sides, only to be contradicted by Dennis Ross, Clinton's special adviser to the region. The official, who did not want to be quoted by name, said it seemed as if Mitchell had abdicated his role completely in recent months. Indeed, Mitchell's frequent visits to Israel and the West Bank slowed to a trickle; his last visit to the region was in December.   When he was there, officials on both sides of the conflict had voiced bewilderment at Mitchell's hands-off approach to the complex negotiating process. With a small staff in Israel, he would shuttle between Jerusalem and Ramallah to meet with senior advisers to the leaders of both sides and then leave after just a few days. In an interview with Newsweek last month, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas openly accused Mitchell of not doing his job. "Every visit by Mitchell, we talked to him and gave him some ideas," he said. "At the end we discovered that he didn't convey any of these ideas to the Israelis. What does it mean?"   A politically attuned man who was once Senate Majority Leader, Mitchell was aware of the complaints about him. His usual comeback was to point to his success in Northern Ireland, which earned him the Presidential Medal of Freedom. For hundreds of days, he liked to say, he was considered a failure, until the final day, when he actually got it done.   Mitchell's resignation letter set off a small panic inside the West Wing earlier in the week. Senior advisers, as well as Obama himself, could sense the increasing difficulty of the job: Administration officials had been unable to convince Israel to halve new settlements in the West Bank, alienating Palestinians, and Israelis were irked in early May when Abbas allied with Hamas, a group that refuses to denounce violence against Israel. But the symbolism of Mitchell leaving several days before Obama's biggest week of outreach to the region projected a vacuum of confidence that anything hopeful, however remote, was on the horizon.   "He wouldn't be leaving at this important hour if he knew there was going to be a significant change in the administration's attitude toward the peace process," said Middle East analyst Gregory Orfalea, who formerly taught at Georgetown's School of Foreign Service. "He's leaving because it's status quo."   Mitchell will be replaced—in the interim by his deputy, David Hale—and another official will take a crack at the quandary. But despite new momentum from Netanyahu's visit next week and Obama's speech Thursday, Mitchell's departure could signal stagnant talks for the next several years. According to Fawaz Gerges, director of the London School of Economics' Middle East Center, "the reality is that, with Mitchell leaving, Barack Obama basically lost the ideological battle [over how to confront the peace process]. By now he'll have to wait for the second term before you can get another concerted effort."      Daniel Stone is Newsweek's White House correspondent.

The Washington Post   Amid the Arab Spring, a U.S.-Saudi split   Nawaf Obaid      May 16 - RIYADH, SAUDI ARABIA -- A tectonic shift has occurred in the U.S.-Saudi relationship. Despite significant pressure from the Obama administration to remain on the sidelines, Saudi leaders sent troops into Manama in March to defend Bahrain’s monarchy and quell the unrest that has shaken that country since February. For more than 60 years, Saudi Arabia has been bound by an unwritten bargain: oil for security. Riyadh has often protested but ultimately acquiesced to what it saw as misguided U.S. policies. But American missteps in the region since Sept. 11, an ill-conceived response to the Arab protest movements and an unconscionable refusal to hold Israel accountable for its illegal settlement building have brought this arrangement to an end. As the Saudis recalibrate the partnership, Riyadh intends to pursue a much more assertive foreign policy, at times conflicting with American interests. The backdrop for this change are the rise of Iranian meddling in the region and the counterproductive policies that the United States has pursued here since Sept. 11. The most significant blunder may have been the invasion of Iraq, which resulted in enormous loss of life and provided Iran an opening to expand its sphere of influence. For years, Iran’s leadership has aimed to foment discord while furthering its geopolitical ambitions. Tehran has long funded Hamas and Hezbollah; recently, its scope of attempted interference has broadened to include the affairs of Arab states from Yemen to Morocco. This month the chief of staff of Iran’s armed forces, Gen. Hasan Firouzabadi, harshly criticized Riyadh over its intervention in Bahrain, claiming this act would spark massive domestic uprisings.   Such remarks are based more on wishful thinking than fact, but Iran’s efforts to destabilize its neighbors are tireless. As Riyadh fights a cold war with Tehran, Washington has shown itself in recent months to be an unwilling and unreliable partner against this threat. The emerging political reality is a Saudi-led Arab world facing off against the aggression of Iran and its non-state proxies. Saudi Arabia will not allow the political unrest in the region to destabilize the Arab monarchies — the Gulf states, Jordan and Morocco. In Yemen, the Saudis are insisting on an orderly transition of power and a dignified exit for President Ali Abdullah Saleh (a courtesy that was not extended to Hosni Mubarak, despite the former Egyptian president’s many years as a strong U.S. ally). To facilitate this handover, Riyadh is leading a diplomatic effort under the auspices of the six-country Gulf Cooperation Council. In Iraq, the Saudi government will continue to pursue a hard-line stance against the Maliki government, which it regards as little more than an Iranian puppet. In Lebanon, Saudi Arabia will act to check the growth of Hezbollah and to ensure that this Iranian proxy does not dominate the country’s political life. Regarding the widespread upheaval in Syria, the Saudis will work to ensure that any potential transition to a post-Assad era is as peaceful and as free of Iranian meddling as possible.  Regarding Israel, Riyadh is adamant that a just settlement, based on King Abdullah’s proposed peace plan, be implemented. This includes a Palestinian state with its capital in East Jerusalem. The United States has lost all credibility on this issue; after casting the sole vote in the U.N. Security Council against censuring Israel for its illegal settlement building, it can no longer act as an objective mediator. This act was a watershed in U.S.-Saudi relations, guaranteeing that Saudi leaders will not push for further compromise from the Palestinians, despite American pressure.   Saudi Arabia remains strong and stable, lending muscle to its invigorated foreign policy. Spiritually, the kingdom plays a unique role for the world’s 1.2 billion Muslims — more than 1 billion of whom are Sunni — as the birthplace of Islam and home of the two holiest cities. Politically, its leaders enjoy broad domestic support, and a growing nationalism has knitted the historically tribal country more closely together. This is largely why widespread protests, much anticipated by Western media in March, never materialized. As the world’s sole energy superpower and the de facto central banker of the global energy markets, Riyadh is the economic powerhouse of the Middle East, representing 25 percent of the combined gross domestic product of the Arab world. The kingdom has amassed more than $550 billion in foreign reserves and is spending more than $150 billion to improve infrastructure, public education, social services and health care.  To counter the threats posed by Iran and transnational terrorist networks, the Saudi leadership is authorizing more than $100 billion of additional military spending to modernize ground forces, upgrade naval capabilities and more. The kingdom is doubling its number of high-quality combat aircraft and adding 60,000 security personnel to the Interior Ministry forces. Plans are underway to create a “Special Forces Command,” based on the U.S. model, to unify the kingdom’s various special forces if needed for rapid deployment abroad. Saudi Arabia has the will and the means to meet its expanded global responsibilities. In some issues, such as counterterrorism and efforts to fight money laundering, the Saudis will continue to be a strong U.S. partner. In areas in which Saudi national security or strategic interests are at stake, the kingdom will pursue its own agenda. With Iran working tirelessly to dominate the region, the Muslim Brotherhood rising in Egypt and unrest on nearly every border, there is simply too much at stake for the kingdom to rely on a security policy written in Washington, which has backfired more often than not and spread instability. The special relationship may never be the same, but from this transformation a more stable and secure Middle East can be born.

Newsweek   Dr. K’s Rx for China   Niall Ferguson      May 15, 2011  -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton thinks the Chinese government is “scared” of the Arab Spring. “They’re worried,” she told Jeffrey Goldberg in the latest Atlantic, “and they are trying to stop history, which is a fool’s errand. They cannot do it.”   These are words—intemperate, undiplomatic, and very likely counterproductive—that you cannot imagine being uttered by her predecessor Henry Kissinger. It is now 40 years since Kissinger went on his secret mission to China, to pave the way for President Richard Nixon’s historic visit the following year. Since then he has visited the country more than 50 times. And if there is one thing he has learned, it is this: the real fool’s errand is to lean on the Chinese. Much has changed in the world since Kissinger’s first trip to China. (In 1971, who would have dared to predict that America’s public enemy No. 1 would be a Saudi-born Islamic fundamentalist skulking in a walled compound in Pakistan?) But at least two things in American foreign policy remain consistent: the relationship with mainland China, revived by Kissinger after more than 20 years in the deep freeze, and Kissinger himself, consulted formally or informally by every president from John F. Kennedy to Barack Obama. On China, Kissinger’s new book, is a reminder of why our leaders still want to pick his brains. Eighty-eight years old this month, he remains without equal as a strategic thinker.  The opening to China is a story Kissinger has told before: how he and Nixon had discerned that country could become a strategic counterweight to the Soviet Union; how he secretly flew to China after feigning illness in Pakistan; how he and Premier Zhou Enlai hammered out the diplomatic basis for Nixon’s official visit (the Shanghai Communiqué). The result was, as he puts it, “a quasi alliance,” which, though initially intended to contain the Soviet Union, ended up outliving the Cold War.   In this telling, however, Kissinger is able to take advantage of recent research that illuminates the Chinese side of the story. The American opening to China was also a Chinese opening to America, actuated above all by Mao Zedong’s fear of encirclement. “Think about this,” Mao told his doctor in 1969. “We have the Soviet Union to the north and the west, India to the south, and Japan to the east. If all our enemies were to unite, attacking us from the north, south, east, and west, what do you think we should do?” The medic had no idea. “Think again,” said Mao. “Beyond Japan is the United States. Didn’t our ancestors counsel negotiating with faraway countries while fighting with those that are near?” It was to explore the American option that Mao recalled four Army marshals from exile. Skirmishes were already underway between Soviet and Chinese forces on the Ussuri River. In October 1970 Mao ordered China’s top leadership to evacuate Beijing and put the People’s Liberation Army on “first-degree combat readiness.” The stakes for China were high indeed—higher than for the United States.  As Kissinger shows, it was far from unusual for Mao to refer to “our ancestors’ counsel.” Despite his lifelong commitment to Marxism-Leninism, Mao was also steeped in the classics of Chinese civilization, as were his close advisers. “We can consult the example of Zhuge Liang’s strategic guiding principle,” Marshal Ye Jian-ying suggested, “when the three states of Wei, Shu, and Wu confronted each other: ‘Ally with Wu in the east to oppose Wei in the north.’ ” The allusion, Kissinger explains, is to Romance of the Three Kingdoms, a 14th-century epic novel set in the so-called Warring States period (475–221 B.C.).   Nor was this the only occasion when China’s communist leaders looked to the distant past for inspiration. Of equal importance to them, Kissinger argues, was The Art of War by Sun Tzu, which dates from the even earlier Spring and Autumn period (770–476 B.C.). “The victorious army/Is victorious first/And seeks battle later”: axioms like this one encouraged Chinese strategists to think of international relations like the board game Weiqi (known in the West as Go), a “game of surrounding pieces.”   Mao shared with China’s prerevolutionary leaders an assumption that China is not like other countries. With a population that amounts to a fifth of humanity, it is Zhongguo: the Middle Kingdom or, perhaps more accurately, the “Central Country.” At times it could even seem like tian xia: “all under heaven.” The best foreign policy for such an empire was to “let barbarians fight barbarians.” If that failed, then the strongest of the barbarians should be embraced and civilized (as happened to the Manchus).   “Domineering and overwhelming … ruthless and aloof, poet and warrior, prophet and scourge”—Mao’s true hero was not Lenin but the tyrannical, book-burning “first emperor,” Qin Shi Huang, who united China in 221 B.C. In a similar way, Kissinger shows, the current generation of Chinese leaders have drawn inspiration from the teachings of Kong Fu Zi (known in the West as Confucius). Their goal, he argues, is not world domination but da tong: “great harmony.”   This goes to the heart of the matter. In 1971, when Kissinger first went to China, the U.S. economy was roughly five times that of the People’s Republic. Forty years later, as a result of the industrial revolution unleashed by Mao’s successor Deng Xiao-ping, it is conceivable that China could overtake America within a decade. This is a feat the Soviet Union never came close to achieving. Moreover, China is now the biggest foreign holder of U.S. Treasury notes, which form an important part of its vast $3 trillion of international reserves. How China will use its newfound economic power may be the most important question of our time. Few Americans are better placed to answer that question than Kissinger, who has dealt with four generations of Chinese leaders.   The most profound insights of On China are psychological. They concern the fundamental cultural differences between a Chinese elite who can look back more than two millennia for inspiration and an American elite whose historical frame of reference is little more than two centuries old. This became most obvious in the wake of June 1989, when Americans recoiled from the use of military force to end the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy demonstrations. To Kissinger’s eyes, it was doubly naive to retaliate to this crackdown with sanctions: “Western concepts of human rights and individual liberties may not be directly translatable … to a civilization for millennia ordered around different concepts. Nor can the traditional Chinese fear of political chaos be dismissed as an anachronistic irrelevancy needing only ‘correction’ by Western enlightenment.”   As China’s first Anglophone leader, Jiang Zemin, explained to Kissinger in 1991: “We never submit to pressure … It is a philosophical principle.”   The United States and China went to war in Korea because of another cultural gap. It came as a surprise to the Americans when Mao ordered Chinese intervention because the military odds looked so unfavorable. But, argues Kissinger, his “motivating force was less to inflict a decisive military first blow than to change the psychological balance, not so much to defeat the enemy as to alter his calculus of risks.” Mao was a master of the ancient Empty City Stratagem, which seeks to conceal weakness with a show of confidence, even aggression. To Westerners, his insistence that he did not fear a nuclear attack seemed unhinged or, at best, callous (“We may lose more than 300 million people. So what? War is war. The years will pass, and we’ll get to work producing more babies than ever before”). But this was classical Chinese bravado, or “offensive deterrence.”    “Chinese negotiators,” observes Kissinger in a passage that should be inwardly digested not just by American diplomats but also by American businessmen before they land in Beijing, “use diplomacy to weave together political, military, and psychological elements into an overall strategic design.” American diplomacy, by contrast, “generally prefers …c to be ‘flexible’; it feels an obligation to break deadlocks with new proposals—unintentionally inviting new deadlocks to elicit new proposals.” We could learn a thing or two from the Chinese, Kissinger implies, particularly Sun Tzu’s concept of shi, meaning the “potential energy” of the overall strategic landscape. Our tendency is to have an agenda of 10 different points, each one to be dealt with separately. They have one big game plan. We are always in a hurry for closure, anxiously watching the minutes tick away. The Chinese value patience; as Mao explained to Kissinger, they measure time in millennia.   Such fundamental cultural differences may give rise to conflict with China in the future, Kissinger warns: “When the Chinese view of preemption encounters the Western concept of deterrence, a vicious circle can result: acts conceived as defensive in China may be treated as aggressive by the outside world; deterrent moves by the West may be interpreted in China as encirclement. The United States and China wrestled with this dilemma repeatedly during the Cold War; to some extent they have not yet found a way to transcend it.”   Could the United States and the People’s Republic come to blows again? The possibility cannot be excluded. As Kissinger reminds us, war was the result when Germany rose to challenge Britain economically and geopolitically 100 years ago. Moreover, the key factor that brought America and China together in the 1970s—the common Soviet enemy the Chinese called “the polar bear”—has vanished from the scene. Old, intractable differences persist over Taiwan and North Korea. What remains is “Chimerica,” a less-than-happy marriage of economic convenience in which one partner does all the saving and the other does all the spending.   In Kissinger’s own words, China’s rise could “make international relations bipolar again,” ushering in a new cold (or possibly even hot) war. Nationalist writers like Liu Mingfu, author of China Dream, urge China to switch from “peaceful development” to “military rise” and look forward to the “duel of the century” with the United States. There are those in Washington, too—apparently including, for the moment, the Obama administration—who would relish a more confrontational relationship.   Yet Kissinger remains hopeful that cooler heads will prevail in Beijing: thinkers like Zheng Bijian, who urges China to “transcend the traditional ways for great powers to emerge” and “not [to] follow the path of Germany leading up to World War I.” Rather than attempting to “organize Asia on the basis of containing China or creating a bloc of democratic states for an ideological crusade,” the United States would do better, Kissinger suggests, to work with China to build a new “Pacific Community.”   Four decades ago, Richard Nixon grasped sooner than most the huge potential of China. “Well,” he mused, “you can just stop and think of what could happen if anybody with a decent system of government got control of that mainland. Good God … There’d be no power in the world that could even—I mean, you put 800 million Chinese to work under a decent system … and they will be the leaders of the world.” That prophecy is being fulfilled in our time. The fact that until now China’s rise has been a boon to the United States rather than a bane owes much to the work of Henry Kissinger. With this book he has given his successors an indispensable guide to continuing the Sino-American “coevolution” he began.      Ferguson is writing a biography of Henry Kissinger.       Article 6.   Hurriyet Daily News   Syria as Turkey’s domestic issue   Yusuf Kanli  May 15, 2011 -- Syria is no Libya for many reasons; not just because it is a country right on the Turkish border or, like Turkey, it has a Kurdish population and an explosion there may ignite an explosion on this side of the border as well.   Like a broken watch that shows correct time twice a day, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan as well occasionally makes some correct analysis. Last week, while comparing the uprising in Libya against the Moammar Gadhafi regime and the growing unrest in the Syrian street against the Baathist regime of Bashar al-Assad, the prime minister correctly said Libya and Syria were two totally different issues for Turkey.   Erdoğan explained while Turkey was very much concerned with what’s happening in Libya and have been undertaking every possible effort to contribute to a quick end to the tumult and restoration of peace and order in Libya, Syria was very much like a domestic incident for Turkey.   As part of its neo-Ottoman drive to enhance its influence in the Middle Eastern territory of the former Ottoman Empire the ruling Justice and development Party, or AKP, government of Turkey has long waived visa requirement in travel between Turkey and Syria. The aim behind that move was to plant the seeds of a future European Union-like Middle Eastern union led by Turkey but the first tangible result was not a marked increase in commercial, business or tourist interactions, but a batch of 250 refugees running from the fire on the Syrian street.   If the problem continues and escalates further in the Syrian street it is probable that the prefabricated facility in the Hatay province constructed to provide temporary lodging to pilgrims during the Hajj season will not suffice in providing a shelter to Syrian refugees who thanks to the no-visa regime in travel between Turkey and Syria may freely escape to Turkey from the trouble in their own street and thus carry the problem to the Turkish street.   For now the separatist Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, terrorists are abiding with an unilateral truce, which is claimed to have been negotiated with the government by Abdullah Öcalan, the chieftain of the gang serving an enforced life term on the İmralı island prison, which according to claims will last until June 15, three days after the June 12 parliamentary elections. Indeed, excluding some rehearsal for a possible mass civilian disobedience campaign after the elections and some exceptional terrorist acts, it might be said that there is nothing extraordinary in Turkey’s southeast bordering Syria, Iraq and Iran, where there are sizeable Kurdish populations.   The “success” of the unrest in Syrian streets in uprooting the government might mean added trouble for Turkey, which has been battling with separatist terrorism for the past 25 years. Turkey remaining silent or supportive of the Assad regime crushing the pressure for a regime change and reform calls of the Syrian street, on the other hand, would seriously imperil the regional role aspired by the AKP governance of Turkey.   Indeed, while the AKP government in Ankara joined the calls of the U.S.-led coalition of the willing that time is up for Moammar Gadhafi in Libya and for peace and safety of his own people Gadhafi must step down, as regards to Syria Ankara, as well as the Western alliance, has been restraining their calls with a shy request from Assad to accelerate reforms.   While Ankara may answer anti-Turkish demonstrations in Libya by closing down the Turkish embassy in Tripoli, the first ever such action by the diplomatic service throughout its modern history, anti-Turkish demonstrations in Damascus can be really costly for Turkey now and in the future.   While the personal friendly relations between Assad and his counterpart in Turkey, Erdoğan, might provide Turkey a golden opportunity to help Syria sail out of the current tumultuous situation. Of course at a time when Erdoğan himself is after converting Turkey into his sultanate of fear under the aegis of advanced democracy it might be absurd to expect him to advise Assad of a democratic way out of the mess in Syria. Yet, as much as Turkey needs to see restoration of peace, security and stability in Syria for domestic security reasons as well as for its regional role, Syria and President Assad need Turkey and Erdoğan to walk the extra mile in reforms advised by them, as the real-politic of the day compels him to do so if he wants to sail out of this problem in one piece.   If, however, despite Turkey’s democracy and reform preaches, the massacres continue in the Syrian street not only the prestige of Erdoğan in the Arab street will be seriously impaired but sooner or later the fire in the Arab street will have a reflection on the Turkish streets.       Article 7.   STRATFOR   The Geopolitics of Israel: Biblical and Modern       The founding principle of geopolitics is that place — geography — plays a significant role in determining how nations will behave. If that theory is true, then there ought to be a deep continuity in a nation's foreign policy. Israel is a laboratory for this theory, since it has existed in three different manifestations in roughly the same place, twice in antiquity and once in modernity. If geopolitics is correct, then Israeli foreign policy, independent of policymakers, technology or the identity of neighbors, ought to have important common features. This is, therefore, a discussion of common principles in Israeli foreign policy over nearly 3,000 years.  For convenience, we will use the term "Israel" to connote all of the Hebrew and Jewish entities that have existed in the Levant since the invasion of the region as chronicled in the Book of Joshua. As always, geopolitics requires a consideration of three dimensions: the internal geopolitics of Israel, the interaction of Israel and the immediate neighbors who share borders with it, and Israel's interaction with what we will call great powers, beyond Israel's borderlands.  Israel has manifested itself three times in history. The first manifestation began with the invasion led by Joshua and lasted through its division into two kingdoms, the Babylonian conquest of the Kingdom of Judah and the deportation to Babylon early in the sixth century B.C. The second manifestation began when Israel was recreated in 540 B.C. by the Persians, who had defeated the Babylonians. The nature of this second manifestation changed in the fourth century B.C., when Greece overran the Persian Empire and Israel, and again in the first century B.C., when the Romans conquered the region.  The second manifestation saw Israel as a small actor within the framework of larger imperial powers, a situation that lasted until the destruction of the Jewish vassal state by the Romans.  Israel's third manifestation began in 1948, following (as in the other cases) an ingathering of t least some of the Jews who had been dispersed after conquests. Israel's founding takes place in the context of the decline and fall of the British Empire and must, at least in part, be understood as part of British imperial history.  During its first 50 years, Israel plays a pivotal role in the confrontation of the United States and the Soviet Union and, in some senses, is hostage to the dynamics of these two countries. In other words, like the first two manifestations of Israel, the third finds Israel continually struggling among independence, internal tension and imperial ambition. Israeli Geography and Borderlands  At its height, under King David, Israel extended from the Sinai to the Euphrates, encompassing Damascus. It occupied some, but relatively little, of the coastal region, an area beginning at what today is Haifa and running south to Jaffa, just north of today's Tel Aviv. The coastal area to the north was held by Phoenicia, the area to the south by Philistines. It is essential to understand that Israel's size and shape shifted over time. For example, Judah under the Hasmoneans did not include the Negev but did include the Golan. The general locale of Israel is fixed. Its precise borders have never been. Thus, it is perhaps better to begin with what never was part of Israel. Israel never included the Sinai Peninsula. Along the coast, it never stretched much farther north than the Litani River in today's Lebanon. Apart from David's extreme extension (and fairly tenuous control) to the north, Israel's territory never stretched as far as Damascus, although it frequently held the Golan Heights. Israel extended many times to both sides of the Jordan but never deep into the Jordanian Desert. It never extended southeast into the Arabian Peninsula.  Israel consists generally of three parts. First, it always has had the northern hill region, stretching from the foothills of Mount Hermon south to Jerusalem. Second, it always contains some of the coastal plain from today's Tel Aviv north to Haifa. Third, it occupies area between Jerusalem and the Jordan River — today's West Bank. At times, it controls all or part of the Negev, including the coastal region between the Sinai to the Tel Aviv area. It may be larger than this at various times in history, and sometimes smaller, but it normally holds all or part of these three regions.  Israel is well-buffered in three directions. The Sinai Desert protects it against the Egyptians. In general, the Sinai has held little attraction for the Egyptians. The difficulty of deploying forces in the eastern Sinai poses severe logistical problems for them, particularly during a prolonged presence. Unless Egypt can rapidly move through the Sinai north into the coastal plain, where it can sustain its forces more readily, deploying in the Sinai is difficult and unrewarding. Therefore, so long as Israel is not so weak as to make an attack on the coastal plain a viable option, or unless Egypt is motivated by an outside imperial power, Israel does not face a threat from the southwest.  Israel is similarly protected from the southeast. The deserts southeast of Eilat-Aqaba are virtually impassable. No large force could approach from that direction, although smaller raiding parties could. The tribes of the Arabian Peninsula lack the reach or the size to pose a threat to Israel, unless massed and aligned with other forces. Even then, the approach from the southeast is not one that they are likely to take. The Negev is secure from that direction.  The eastern approaches are similarly secured by desert, which begins about 20 to 30 miles east of the Jordan River. While indigenous forces exist in the borderland east of the Jordan, they lack the numbers to be able to penetrate decisively west of the Jordan. Indeed, the normal model is that, so long as Israel controls Judea and Samaria (the modern-day West Bank), then the East Bank of the Jordan River is under the political and sometimes military domination of Israel — sometimes directly through settlement, sometimes indirectly through political influence, or economic or security leverage.  Israel's vulnerability is in the north. There is no natural buffer between Phoenicia and its successor entities (today's Lebanon) to the direct north. The best defense line for Israel in the north is the Litani River, but this is not an insurmountable boundary under any circumstance. However, the area along the coast north of Israel does not present a serious threat. The coastal area prospers through trade in the Mediterranean basin. It is oriented toward the sea and to the trade routes to the east, not to the south. If it does anything, this area protects those trade routes and has no appetite for a conflict that might disrupt trade. It stays out of Israel's way, for the most part.  Moreover, as a commercial area, this region is generally wealthy, a factor that increases predators around it and social conflict within. It is an area prone to instability. Israel frequently tries to extend its influence northward for commercial reasons, as one of the predators, and this can entangle Israel in its regional politics. But barring this self-induced problem, the threat to Israel from the north is minimal, despite the absence of natural boundaries and the large population. On occasion, there is spillover of conflicts from the north, but not to a degree that might threaten regime survival in Israel.  The neighbor that is always a threat lies to the northeast. Syria — or, more precisely, the area governed by Damascus at any time — is populous and frequently has no direct outlet to the sea. It is, therefore, generally poor. The area to its north, Asia Minor, is heavily mountainous. Syria cannot project power to the north except with great difficulty, but powers in Asia Minor can move south. Syria's eastern flank is buffered by a desert that stretches to the Euphrates. Therefore, when there is no threat from the north, Syria's interest — after securing itself internally — is to gain access to the coast. Its primary channel is directly westward, toward the rich cities of the northern Levantine coast, with which it trades heavily. An alternative interest is southwestward, toward the southern Levantine coast controlled by Israel.  As can be seen, Syria can be interested in Israel only selectively. When it is interested, it has a serious battle problem. To attack Israel, it would have to strike between Mount Hermon and the Sea of Galilee, an area about 25 miles wide. The Syrians potentially can attack south of the sea, but only if they are prepared to fight through this region and then attack on extended supply lines. If an attack is mounted along the main route, Syrian forces must descend the Golan Heights and then fight through the hilly Galilee before reaching the coastal plain — sometimes with guerrillas holding out in the Galilean hills. The Galilee is an area that is relatively easy to defend and difficult to attack. Therefore, it is only once Syria takes the Galilee, and can control its lines of supply against guerrilla attack, that its real battle begins.  To reach the coast or move toward Jerusalem, Syria must fight through a plain in front of a line of low hills. This is the decisive battleground where massed Israeli forces, close to lines of supply, can defend against dispersed Syrian forces on extended lines of supply. It is no accident that Megiddo — or Armageddon, as the plain is sometimes referred to — has apocalyptic meaning. This is the point at which any move from Syria would be decided. But a Syrian offensive would have a tough fight to reach Megiddo, and a tougher one as it deploys on the plain.  On the surface, Israel lacks strategic depth, but this is true only on the surface. It faces limited threats from southern neighbors. To its east, it faces only a narrow strip of populated area east of the Jordan. To the north, there is a maritime commercial entity. Syria operating alone, forced through the narrow gap of the Mount Hermon-Galilee line and operating on extended supply lines, can be dealt with readily.  There is a risk of simultaneous attacks from multiple directions. Depending on the forces deployed and the degree of coordination between them, this can pose a problem for Israel. However, even here the Israelis have the tremendous advantage of fighting on interior lines. Egypt and Syria, fighting on external lines (and widely separated fronts), would have enormous difficulty transferring forces from one front to another. Israel, on interior lines (fronts close to each other with good transportation), would be able to move its forces from front to front rapidly, allowing for sequential engagement and thereby the defeat of enemies. Unless enemies are carefully coordinated and initiate war simultaneously — and deploy substantially superior force on at least one front — Israel can initiate war at a time of its choosing or else move its forces rapidly between fronts, negating much of the advantage of size that the attackers might have.  There is another aspect to the problem of multifront war. Egypt usually has minimal interests along the Levant, having its own coast and an orientation to the south toward the headwaters of the Nile. On the rare occasions when Egypt does move through the Sinai and attacks to the north and northeast, it is in an expansionary mode. By the time it consolidates and exploits the coastal plain, it would be powerful enough to threaten Syria. From Syria's point of view, the only thing more dangerous than Israel is an Egypt in control of Israel. Therefore, the probability of a coordinated north-south strike at Israel is rare, is rarely coordinated and usually is not designed to be a mortal blow. It is defeated by Israel's strategic advantage of interior lines.  Israeli Geography and the Convergence Zone Therefore, it is not surprising that Israel's first incarnation lasted as long as it did — some five centuries. What is interesting and what must be considered is why Israel (now considered as the northern kingdom) was defeated by the Assyrians and Judea, then defeated by Babylon. To understand this, we need to consider the broader geography of Israel's location.  Israel is located on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea, on the Levant. As we have seen, when Israel is intact, it will tend to be the dominant power in the Levant. Therefore, Israeli resources must generally be dedicated for land warfare, leaving little over for naval warfare. In general, although Israel had excellent harbors and access to wood for shipbuilding, it never was a major Mediterranean naval power. It never projected power into the sea. The area to the north of Israel has always been a maritime power, but Israel, the area south of Mount Hermon, was always forced to be a land power.  The Levant in general and Israel in particular has always been a magnet for great powers. No Mediterranean empire could be fully secure unless it controlled the Levant. Whether it was Rome or Carthage, a Mediterranean empire that wanted to control both the northern and southern littorals needed to anchor its eastern flank on the Levant. For one thing, without the Levant, a Mediterranean power would be entirely dependent on sea lanes for controlling the other shore. Moving troops solely by sea creates transport limitations and logistical problems. It also leaves imperial lines vulnerable to interdiction — sometimes merely from pirates, a problem that plagued Rome's sea transport. A land bridge, or a land bridge with minimal water crossings that can be easily defended, is a vital supplement to the sea for the movement of large numbers of troops. Once the Hellespont is crossed, the coastal route through southern Turkey, down the Levant and along the Mediterranean's southern shore, provides such an alternative.  There is an additional consideration. If a Mediterranean empire leaves the Levant unoccupied, it opens the door to the possibility of a great power originating to the east seizing the ports of the Levant and challenging the Mediterranean power for maritime domination. In short, control of the Levant binds a Mediterranean empire together while denying a challenger from the east the opportunity to enter the Mediterranean. Holding the Levant, and controlling Israel, is a necessary preventive measure for a Mediterranean empire.  Israel is also important to any empire originating to the east of Israel, either in the Tigris-Euphrates basin or in Persia. For either, security could be assured only once it had an anchor on the Levant. Macedonian expansion under Alexander demonstrated that a power controlling Levantine and Turkish ports could support aggressive operations far to the east, to the Hindu Kush and beyond. While Turkish ports might have sufficed for offensive operations, simply securing the Bosporus still left the southern flank exposed. Therefore, by holding the Levant, an eastern power protected itself against attacks from Mediterranean powers.  The Levant was also important to any empire originating to the north or south of Israel. If Egypt decided to move beyond the Nile Basin and North Africa eastward, it would move first through the Sinai and then northward along the coastal plain, securing sea lanes to Egypt. When Asia Minor powers such as the Ottoman Empire developed, there was a natural tendency to move southward to control the eastern Mediterranean. The Levant is the crossroads of continents, and Israel lies in the path of many imperial ambitions.  Israel therefore occupies what might be called the convergence zone of the Eastern Hemisphere. A European power trying to dominate the Mediterranean or expand eastward, an eastern power trying to dominate the space between the Hindu Kush and the Mediterranean, a North African power moving toward the east, or a northern power moving south — all must converge on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean and therefore on Israel. Of these, the European power and the eastern power must be the most concerned with Israel. For either, there is no choice but to secure it as an anchor. Internal Geopolitics  Israel is geographically divided into three regions, which traditionally have produced three different types of people. Its coastal plain facilitates commerce, serving as the interface between eastern trade routes and the sea. It is the home of merchants and manufacturers, cosmopolitans — not as cosmopolitan as Phoenicia or Lebanon, but cosmopolitan for Israel. The northeast is hill country, closest to the unruliness north of the Litani River and to the Syrian threat. It breeds farmers and warriors. The area south of Jerusalem is hard desert country, more conducive to herdsman and warriors than anything else. Jerusalem is where these three regions are balanced and governed.  There are obviously deep differences built into Israel's geography and inhabitants, particularly between the herdsmen of the southern deserts and the northern hill dwellers. The coastal dwellers, rich but less warlike than the others, hold the balance or are the prize to be pursued. In the division of the original kingdom between Israel and Judea, we saw the alliance of the coast with the Galilee, while Jerusalem was held by the desert dwellers. The consequence of the division was that Israel in the north ultimately was conquered by Assyrians from the northeast, while Babylon was able to swallow Judea.  Social divisions in Israel obviously do not have to follow geographical lines. However, over time, these divisions must manifest themselves. For example, the coastal plain is inherently more cosmopolitan than the rest of the country. The interests of its inhabitants lie more with trading partners in the Mediterranean and the rest of the world than with their countrymen. Their standard of living is higher, and their commitment to traditions is lower. Therefore, there is an inherent tension between their immediate interests and those of the Galileans, who live more precarious, warlike lives. Countries can be divided over lesser issues — and when Israel is divided, it is vulnerable even to regional threats.  We say "even" because geography dictates that regional threats are less menacing than might be expected. The fact that Israel would be outnumbered demographically should all its neighbors turn on it is less important than the fact that it has adequate buffers in most directions, that the ability of neighbors to coordinate an attack is minimal and that their appetite for such an attack is even less. The single threat that Israel faces from the northeast can readily be managed if the Israelis create a united front there. When Israel was overrun by a Damascus-based power, it was deeply divided internally.  It is important to add one consideration to our discussion of buffers, which is diplomacy. The main neighbors of Israel are Egyptians, Syrians and those who live on the east bank of Jordan. This last group is a negligible force demographically, and the interests of the Syrians and Egyptians are widely divergent. Egypt's interests are to the south and west of its territory; the Sinai holds no attraction. Syria is always threatened from multiple directions, and alliance with Egypt adds little to its security. Therefore, under the worst of circumstances, Egypt and Syria have difficulty supporting each other. Under the best of circumstances, from Israel's point of view, it can reach a political accommodation with Egypt, securing its southwestern frontier politically as well as by geography, thus freeing Israel to concentrate on the northern threats and opportunities. Israel and the Great Powers  The threat to Israel rarely comes from the region, except when the Israelis are divided internally. The conquests of Israel occur when powers not adjacent to it begin forming empires. Babylon, Persia, Macedonia, Rome, Turkey and Britain all controlled Israel politically, sometimes for worse and sometimes for better. Each dominated it militarily, but none was a neighbor of Israel. This is a consistent pattern. Israel can resist its neighbors; danger arises when more distant powers begin playing imperial games. Empires can bring force to bear that Israel cannot resist.  Israel therefore has this problem: It would be secure if it could confine itself to protecting its interests from neighbors, but it cannot confine itself because its geographic location invariably draws larger, more distant powers toward Israel. Therefore, while Israel's military can focus only on immediate interests, its diplomatic interests must look much further. Israel is constantly entangled with global interests (as the globe is defined at any point), seeking to deflect and align with broader global powers. When it fails in this diplomacy, the consequences can be catastrophic.  Israel exists in three conditions. First, it can be a completely independent state. This condition occurs when there are no major imperial powers external to the region. We might call this the David model. Second, it can live as part of an imperial system — either as a subordinate ally, as a moderately autonomous entity or as a satrapy. In any case, it maintains its identity but loses room for independent maneuvering in foreign policy and potentially in domestic policy. We might call this the Persian model in its most beneficent form. Finally, Israel can be completely crushed — with mass deportations and migrations, with a complete loss of autonomy and minimal residual autonomy. We might call this the Babylonian model.  The Davidic model exists primarily when there is no external imperial power needing control of the Levant that is in a position either to send direct force or to support surrogates in the immediate region. The Persian model exists when Israel aligns itself with the foreign policy interests of such an imperial power, to its own benefit. The Babylonian model exists when Israel miscalculates on the broader balance of power and attempts to resist an emerging hegemon. When we look at Israeli behavior over time, the periods when Israel does not confront hegemonic powers outside the region are not rare, but are far less common than when it is confronting them.  Given the period of the first iteration of Israel, it would be too much to say that the Davidic model rarely comes into play, but certainly since that time, variations of the Persian and Babylonian models have dominated. The reason is geographic. Israel is normally of interest to outside powers because of its strategic position. While Israel can deal with local challenges effectively, it cannot deal with broader challenges. It lacks the economic or military weight to resist. Therefore, it is normally in the process of managing broader threats or collapsing because of them.  The Geopolitics of Contemporary Israel Let us then turn to the contemporary manifestation of Israel. Israel was recreated because of the interaction between a regional great power, the Ottoman Empire, and a global power, Great Britain. During its expansionary phase, the Ottoman Empire sought to dominate the eastern Mediterranean as well as both its northern and southern coasts. One thrust went through the Balkans toward central Europe. The other was toward Egypt. Inevitably, this required that the Ottomans secure the Levant.  For the British, the focus on the eastern Mediterranean was as the primary sea lane to India. As such, Gibraltar and the Suez were crucial. The importance of the Suez was such that the presence of a hostile, major naval force in the eastern Mediterranean represented a direct threat to British interests. It followed that defeating the Ottoman Empire during World War I and breaking its residual naval power was critical. The British, as was shown at Gallipoli, lacked the resources to break the Ottoman Empire by main force. They resorted to a series of alliances with local forces to undermine the Ottomans. One was an alliance with Bedouin tribes in the Arabian Peninsula; others involved covert agreements with anti-Turkish, Arab interests from the Levant to the Persian Gulf. A third, minor thrust was aligning with Jewish interests globally, particularly those interested in the refounding of Israel. Britain had little interest in this goal, but saw such discussions as part of the process of destabilizing the Ottomans.  The strategy worked. Under an agreement with France, the Ottoman province of Syria was divided into two parts on a line roughly running east-west between the sea and Mount Hermon. The northern part was given to France and divided into Lebanon and a rump Syria entity. The southern part was given to Britain and was called Palestine, after the Ottoman administrative district Filistina. Given the complex politics of the Arabian Peninsula, the British had to find a home for a group of Hashemites, which they located on the east bank of the Jordan River and designated, for want of a better name, the Trans-Jordan — the other side of the Jordan. Palestine looked very much like traditional Israel.  The ideological foundations of Zionism are not our concern here, nor are the pre- and post-World War II migrations of Jews, although those are certainly critical. What is important for purposes of this analysis are two things: First, the British emerged economically and militarily crippled from World War II and unable to retain their global empire, Palestine included. Second, the two global powers that emerged after World War II — the United States and the Soviet Union — were engaged in an intense struggle for the eastern Mediterranean after World War II, as can be seen in the Greek and Turkish issues at that time. Neither wanted to see the British Empire survive, each wanted the Levant, and neither was prepared to make a decisive move to take it.  Both the United States and the Soviet Union saw the re-creation of Israel as an opportunity to introduce their power to the Levant. The Soviets thought they might have some influence over Israel due to ideology. The Americans thought they might have some influence given the role of American Jews in the founding. Neither was thinking particularly clearly about the matter, because neither had truly found its balance after World War II. Both knew the Levant was important, but neither saw the Levant as a central battleground at that moment. Israel slipped through the cracks.  Once the question of Jewish unity was settled through ruthless action by David Ben Gurion's government, Israel faced a simultaneous threat from all of its immediate neighbors. However, as we have seen, the threat in 1948 was more apparent than real. The northern Levant, Lebanon, was fundamentally disunited — far more interested in regional maritime trade and concerned about control from Damascus. It posed no real threat to Israel. Jordan, settling the eastern bank of the Jordan River, was an outside power that had been transplanted into the region and was more concerned about native Arabs — the Palestinians — than about Israel. The Jordanians secretly collaborated with Israel. Egypt did pose a threat, but its ability to maintain lines of supply across the Sinai was severely limited and its genuine interest in engaging and destroying Israel was more rhetorical than real. As usual, the Egyptians could not afford the level of effort needed to move into the Levant. Syria by itself had a very real interest in Israel's defeat, but by itself was incapable of decisive action.  The exterior lines of Israel's neighbors prevented effective, concerted action. Israel's interior lines permitted efficient deployment and redeployment of force. It was not obvious at the time, but in retrospect we can see that once Israel existed, was united and had even limited military force, its survival was guaranteed. That is, so long as no great power was opposed to its existence.  From its founding until the Camp David Accords re-established the Sinai as a buffer with Egypt, Israel's strategic problem was this: So long as Egypt was in the Sinai, Israel's national security requirements outstripped its military capabilities. It could not simultaneously field an army, maintain its civilian economy and produce all the weapons and supplies needed for war. Israel had to align itself with great powers who saw an opportunity to pursue other interests by arming Israel.  Israel's first patron was the Soviet Union — through Czechoslovakia — which supplied weapons before and after 1948 in the hopes of using Israel to gain a foothold in the eastern Mediterranean. Israel, aware of the risks of losing autonomy, also moved into a relationship with a declining great power that was fighting to retain its empire: France. Struggling to hold onto Algeria and in constant tension with Arabs, France saw Israel as a natural ally. And apart from the operation against Suez in 1956, Israel saw in France a patron that was not in a position to reduce Israeli autonomy. However, with the end of the Algerian war and the realignment of France in the Arab world, Israel became a liability to France and, after 1967, Israel lost French patronage.  Israel did not become a serious ally of the Americans until after 1967. Such an alliance was in the American interest. The United States had, as a strategic imperative, the goal of keeping the Soviet navy out of the Mediterranean or, at least, blocking its unfettered access. That meant that Turkey, controlling the Bosporus, had to be kept in the American bloc. Syria and Iraq shifted policies in the late 1950s and by the mid-1960s had been armed by the Soviets. This made Turkey's position precarious: If the Soviets pressed from the north while Syria and Iraq pressed from the south, the outcome would be uncertain, to say the least, and the global balance of power was at stake. The United States used Iran to divert Iraq's attention. Israel was equally useful in diverting Syria's attention. So long as Israel threatened Syria from the south, it could not divert its forces to the north. That helped secure Turkey at a relatively low cost in aid and risk. By aligning itself with the interests of a great power, Israel lost some of its room for maneuver: For example, in 1973, it was limited by the United States in what it could do to Egypt. But those limitations aside, it remained autonomous internally and generally free to pursue its strategic interests.  The end of hostilities with Egypt, guaranteed by the Sinai buffer zone, created a new era for Israel. Egypt was restored to its traditional position, Jordan was a marginal power on the east bank, Lebanon was in its normal, unstable mode, and only Syria was a threat. However, it was a threat that Israel could easily deal with. Syria by itself could not threaten the survival of Israel.  Following Camp David (an ironic name), Israel was in its Davidic model, in a somewhat modified sense. Its survival was not at stake. Its problems — the domination of a large, hostile population and managing events in the northern Levant — were subcritical (meaning that, though these were not easy tasks, they did not represent fundamental threats to national survival, so long as Israel retained national unity). When unified, Israel has never been threatened by its neighbors. Geography dictates against it. Israel's danger will come only if a great power seeks to dominate the Mediterranean Basin or to occupy the region between Afghanistan and the Mediterranean. In the short period since the fall of the Soviet Union, this has been impossible. There has been no great power with the appetite and the will for such an adventure. But 15 years is not even a generation, and Israel must measure its history in centuries.  It is the nature of the international system to seek balance. The primary reality of the world today is the overwhelming power of the United States. The United States makes few demands on Israel that matter. However, it is the nature of things that the United States threatens the interests of other great powers who, individually weak, will try to form coalitions against it. Inevitably, such coalitions will arise. That will be the next point of danger for Israel.  In the event of a global rivalry, the United States might place onerous requirements on Israel. Alternatively, great powers might move into the Jordan River valley or ally with Syria, move into Lebanon or ally with Israel. The historical attraction of the eastern shore of the Mediterranean would focus the attention of such a power and lead to attempts to assert control over the Mediterranean or create a secure Middle Eastern empire. In either event, or some of the others discussed, it would create a circumstance in which Israel might face a Babylonian catastrophe or be forced into some variation of a Persian or Roman subjugation.  Israel's danger is not a Palestinian rising. Palestinian agitation is an irritant that Israel can manage so long as it does not undermine Israeli unity. Whether it is managed by domination or by granting the Palestinians a vassal state matters little. Nor can Israel be threatened by its neighbors. Even a unified attack by Syria and Egypt would fail, for the reasons discussed. Israel's real threat, as can be seen in history, lies in the event of internal division and/or a great power, coveting Israel's geographical position, marshalling force that is beyond its capacity to resist. Even that can be managed if Israel has a patron whose interests involve denying the coast to another power.  Israel's reality is this. It is a small country, yet must manage threats arising far outside of its region. It can survive only if it maneuvers with great powers commanding enormously greater resources. Israel cannot match the resources and, therefore, it must be constantly clever. There are periods when it is relatively safe because of great power alignments, but its normal condition is one of global unease. No nation can be clever forever, and Israel's history shows that some form of subordination is inevitable. Indeed, it is to a very limited extent subordinate to the United States now.  For Israel, the retention of a Davidic independence is difficult. Israel's strategy must be to manage its subordination effectively by dealing with its patron cleverly, as it did with Persia. But cleverness is not a geopolitical concept. It is not permanent, and it is not assured. And that is the perpetual crisis of Jerusalem.                                      1                      dir   Project \G{00020 0046}# 2.0#0#C: \Windows \system3 e2.tlb #OLE Aut omation Tem plate s\Avi\De sktop\1  May.dotxN   8D04C-5B FA-101B- BDE5€ƒAA€  m Files\@Common icrosoft  Shared\ OFFICE12 \MSO.DLL&amp;#G  Libra,ry Forms&gt; rD452EE@1-E08F 8C4D0BB4a rFM20L'B 00}#:0B E657B-D2 8A-47E2- 8D52-CAD E29B77FD ta\Local ¡\Word8 .0ÀbB7.exd hisDocum@entG       __SRP_0   *\CC:\Users\Avi\Desktop\1 May.dotxrU Project1 Project ThisDocument C:\PROGRA~1\COMMON~1\MICROS~1\VBA\VBA6\VBE6.DLL C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office12\MSWORD.OLB C:\Windows\system32\stdole2.tlb stdole Document   C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\OFFICE12\MSO.DLL Office   C:\Windows\system32\FM20.DLL MSForms   C:\Users\Avi\AppData\Local\Temp\Word8.0\MSForms.exd         __SRP_1         __SRP_2         __SRP_3         ThisDocument   :1TemplateProject.ThisDocument 	 \Rffff*0B4f6db050ǟ Attribut e VB_Nam e = "Thi sDocumen 1Templa teProjec hGlobaBl Cre atabl Pr@edecla Tru  BEx0pose $Cust0omiz       _VBA_PROJECT   G{000204EF-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}#4.0#9#C:\PROGRA~1\COMMON~1\MICROS~1\VBA\VBA6\VBE6.DLL#Visual Basic For Applications G{00020905-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}#8.4#0#C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office12\MSWORD.OLB#Microsoft Word 12.0 Object Library G{00020430-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}#2.0#0#C:\Windows\system32\stdole2.tlb#OLE Automation CC:\Users\Avi\Desktop\1 May.dotx *\C1 May.dotx G{2DF8D04C-5BFA-101B-BDE5-00AA0044DE52}#2.4#0#C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\OFFICE12\MSO.DLL#Microsoft Office 12.0 Object Library G{0D452EE1-E08F-101A-852E-02608C4D0BB4}#2.0#0#C:\Windows\system32\FM20.DLL#Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library G{380E657B-D28A-47E2-8D52-CADE29B77FDD}#2.0#0#C:\Users\Avi\AppData\Local\Temp\Word8.0\MSForms.exd#Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library ThisDocument 0B4f6db050 ThisDocument WordS1 Project1   stdole Project- ThisDocument&lt; _Evaluate TemplateProject Eà Office MSFormsC DefaultOcxName4&amp;¥à DefaultOcxName3%¥à DefaultOcxName2$¥à DefaultOcxName1#¥à DefaultOcxName Documentj Macro1 Macro2 Macro3 Macro4       PROJECT   ID="{F25E7008-C06B-4851-BD1E-6A386A33C393}"    Document=ThisDocument/&amp;H00000000   Name="Project"   HelpContextID="0"   VersionCompatible32="393222000"   CMG="585A9F25A325A325A325A3"   DPB="DFDD1823182D9E2E9E2E9E"   GC="6664A1ACAFB437B537B5C8"      [Host Extender Info]   &amp;H00000001={3832D640-CF90-11CF-8E43-00A0C911005A};VBE;&amp;H00000000   &amp;H00000002={000209F2-0000-0000-C000-000000000046};Word8.0;&amp;H00000000          PROJECTwm   ThisDocument ThisDocument   </h5>

The Illusion of Peace with Syria


Elliott Abrams





May 23, 2011 -- The news from Syria grows grimmer by the day—more peaceful protesters killed, ten thousand arrested in the past week, army units shelling residential neighborhoods. 


But the Obama administration’s response has not grown grimmer or louder. As recently as May 6, Secretary of State Clinton was still talking about a “reform agenda” in Syria, as if Bashar al-Assad were a slightly misguided bureaucrat rather than the murderer of roughly 1,000 unarmed demonstrators. As for the president, though the White House has issued a couple of statements in his name, he has yet to say one word on camera about the bloodletting in Syria. This is not a small matter, for a tough statement attacking the regime’s repression and giving the demonstrators moral support would immediately circulate over the Internet. American sanctions against Syria, meanwhile, have not named Assad, and there has been no call for him to step down.


Why is the administration appearing to stick with Assad and refusing to call for his ouster? A key reason may be the hope that an Israeli-Syrian peace deal can be arranged. 


From the day it came to office, the Obama administration clearly wanted to win an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement. There has been no progress during its two years in office, mostly because the White House insisted on a 100 percent construction freeze in the West Bank settlements and Jerusalem as a precondition for negotiations. This was politically impossible in Israel, and also meant that Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas could not come to the table lest he appear to be asking less from Israel than the Americans.


With negotiations frozen, the Palestinians turned to unilateral measures: seeking a United Nations vote admitting the State of Palestine to membership and getting dozens of countries to recognize a Palestinian state. Meanwhile, their delegitimization campaign against Israel continued apace, especially in Europe, where calls for boycotts and sanctions spread. On the pro-Israel side there was also consideration of unilateral measures—steps to head off the Palestinians diplomatically (several of which I described and supported in the April 11 Weekly Standard).


Some forlorn hope may still have existed inside the administration that a compromise on construction could bring the Palestinians back to the table with the government of Israel—until the agreement between Hamas and Fatah was signed on April 27. This agreement, unless and until it collapses, makes Israeli concessions or new flexibility in the West Bank impossible and puts paid to the entire “peace process.” It brings Hamas into the Palestinian Authority government, ending a period of several years when Palestinian Security Forces have cooperated with the Israel Defense Forces against terrorism and against Hamas in particular. It will also bring Hamas—next year and for the first time—into the PLO, the body charged with negotiating peace with Israel. Even Yasser Arafat resisted that development when he headed the PLO, and it seems obvious that Israel cannot negotiate peace with an anti-Semitic terrorist group bent on its destruction.


So where can the White House turn if it wants some kind of peace process in the Middle East? Syria. After all, in his first term as prime minister, back in 1998, Benjamin Netanyahu did authorize indirect negotiations with Syria. And the IDF—and especially Ehud Barak, a former head of the IDF, Israel’s defense minister, and a close adviser to Netanyahu—has long favored such a deal. The IDF theory was that if Syria made peace, so would Lebanon, and then Israel would be at peace with all four neighboring Arab states. And it can be argued now that Assad may see negotiations with Israel as a way to climb back from the pariah status he is earning, making him at this juncture truly open to a new peace process.


Such thinking, whether in Jerusalem or the White House, is foolish and even grotesque. There is no possibility that Assad would negotiate seriously and that an agreement could be attained. He is now clinging desperately to power, and his only true allies are Iran and Hezbollah. Yet Israel’s (and, one hopes, our own) key precondition to any agreement would necessarily be a clean break in those relationships: an end to the Syrian alliance with Hezbollah and Iran. Otherwise Israel would be giving the Golan, in effect, to Iran—a suicidal act. No Israeli government would do it, which suggests that negotiations with Assad would have no purpose.


Assad may indeed be open to commencing a negotiation as a means to escape international isolation, but that’s all the more reason not to give it to him. Prime Minister Ehud Olmert’s 2008 talks with Syria (via Turkey) allowed Syria to escape the partial isolation the United States had imposed on it in that decade, with zero gain for Israel. This is not an experiment worth repeating, for the Assad regime is today even more despicable than it was three years ago.


To react to the murders now taking place all over Syria by embracing the Assad regime would be morally indefensible. Whether Assad can be overthrown soon by the people of Syria is a fair question to ask. Will the army stay with him, or will Sunni units rebel? Will the Sunni business elites turn against him? How long can the regime survive? We do not yet know the answers. But surely we must avoid any step that could help Assad, rehabilitate his regime, or undermine the courageous struggle of peaceful demonstrators in the streets of Syria. 


The peace agreements that Israel signed with Egypt and Jordan were real achievements, but there will be no such agreements with the Palestinians or with Syria in the foreseeable future. The Palestinians have taken themselves out of the game for now. We cannot turn from them to the Syrians while Assad’s troops are using howitzers and sniper rifles against his people. This is the time not for diplomatic engagement with Assad, but for diplomacy aimed at quarantining his regime and helping bring it down. The White House should dismiss any remaining dreams of a “peace process” with Syria to substitute for the Palestinian version and face facts: There will be no peace with the butcher who rules Syria today.

A democratic Arab world would welcome peace with Israel
Hamid Alkifaey

One could reasonably argue that the golden opportunity for peace in the Middle East was blown away when Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated on Nov. 4, 1995. 
He was the only Israeli leader capable of making peace with the Palestinians, and was about to do so had it not been for the bullets of Yigal Amir, the right-wing religious zealot who believed in the “winner takes all” principle. 
One could also claim that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and its global ramifications are responsible for agitating religious extremism in the Muslim world as a whole, and among Palestinians in particular. Prior to 1987, there was hardly any Islamic factor in Palestinian resistance. The Hamas and Islamic Jihad groups were established after the 1987 intifada. From this we deduce that extremism on the Israeli side led to the same on the Palestinian side, and consequently in other Muslim countries, which manifests in popular opposition to traditional and despotic regimes.
The Arab world is currently going through a social and political revolution that has so far claimed two “entrenched” regimes in Tunisia and Egypt. At least three other regimes in the region are fighting for their lives, and are not expected to survive. There will soon be different styles of government in Libya, Yemen and Syria. This much is certain. 
Will there be a different policy toward Israel? Certainly. But this will take time to take shape, since there are more pressing national priorities, such as political and economic reforms. Israel has long branded the Arab world as tribal and undemocratic, in order to brand itself the only democracy in the Middle East. Well, soon enough it won’t be. Many of its neighbors will soon join the democratic world as demands for democracy grow. Democracy will mean more development, prosperity and people’s power. It means more popular participation in decision making and awareness of the possibilities of the nation and what it can and cannot do. It may not mean more hostility toward Israel if the latter knows how to deal with it. But there will be tension if Israel continues to follow extreme policies, which it will under the current leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu. 
The Palestinians must achieve their right to establish their own state on their land. This right has been recognized by almost everyone except a minority of extremists in Israel, led by Netanyahu. Free and democratic Arab countries won’t shrink from supporting this Palestinian right under any circumstances. Muslims will not give up on East Jerusalem, either. Arab regimes have been weak in the past. Democracy will strengthen them, but also add reason to Arab governance. Most Arabs have accepted Israel’s right to exist, and accepted U.N. resolutions 242 and 338, but Israeli intransigence is not helping them formulate a unified position. 
Democratic Egypt won’t be a threat to Israel as the Egyptian military, which will continue to be highly influential in Egypt’s politics in the foreseeable future, will not risk another war with Israel. Egyptians under a democratic regime will be seeking better living standards, better laws to govern the country and more rights as citizens. They won’t be pressing their government to fight Israel; on the contrary, they want a stable economy where things will be better for future generations. But Israel may aggravate the situation by electing extremists and following extreme policies. This will strengthen the hands of the hawks in the Arab world. Moderate Israel under reasonable and realistic leaders should have nothing to fear from Egypt, with which it has an enduring peace treaty. 
The situation with Syria may not be exactly the same, however, especially when the two countries are still officially in a state of war. The regime of Bashar Assad, and his father before him, would have never started a war with Israel unilaterally. It also suited them not to have a peace treaty. Any new Syrian leader is not likely (for a considerable period of time) to initiate a move toward a peace agreement with Israel as this will weaken his position domestically. Nor will he launch a war, however, since such a war will not result in victory. A democratic regime in Syria, or any other Arab country for that matter, will need a good 10 years to build democratic institutions and stabilize a modern market economy needed in any democracy. So, war won’t be on the agenda in the near future.
Prosperity increases the public’s stake in a stable economy, and this will make people want to compromise to make their country more prosperous and stable. However, everything will depend on how prepared the free world is to help new democracies in the Middle East survive and prosper. Small Islamic groups, organized and armed with religious zeal, could hijack power from the moderates. This would lead to a disaster for the whole region. Therefore, it is imperative for the free world, Israel included, not to leave matters to chance. A proactive stance is needed to nurture democracy and help moderate forces organize themselves in order to govern the region

The Awkward Exit of Mideast Envoy George Mitchell


Daniel Stone





May 13, 2011 -- Two days after Barack Obama's inauguration, George Mitchell was named special envoy for Middle East peace. With the new president standing beside Mitchell and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Vice President Joe Biden took the podium and extolled Mitchell's reputation and experience having brokered peace in Northern Ireland, calling him an "outstanding public servant" with "incredible capacity." In the press, Mitchell was praised as the right man for the job at the right time.


On Friday, though, that capacity had reached its limit, and Mitchell told his bosses in the West Wing that he'd had enough. His reasons, he said, were personal—the kind of nebulous rationale that leaves ample room for interpretation. Unmentioned were the months of frustration that Mitchell had built up as direct negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians became more difficult and the peace process further off.


The timing of Mitchell's departure couldn't be more awkward. Obama will meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Jordan's King Abdullah next week, as well as deliver a major speech on Middle East policy. But the resignation didn't come as a surprise to those who worked closest with Mitchell. A State Department official described to Newsweek a man increasingly annoyed by both parties' constant moving of the goal posts and the constraints of the administration's unshakeable political instinct to support Israel.


The strain was noticeable in the Middle East. In a recent interview with Newsweek, one senior Israeli official said Mitchell often would say one thing about the direction the U.S. was taking with the two sides, only to be contradicted by Dennis Ross, Clinton's special adviser to the region. The official, who did not want to be quoted by name, said it seemed as if Mitchell had abdicated his role completely in recent months. Indeed, Mitchell's frequent visits to Israel and the West Bank slowed to a trickle; his last visit to the region was in December.


When he was there, officials on both sides of the conflict had voiced bewilderment at Mitchell's hands-off approach to the complex negotiating process. With a small staff in Israel, he would shuttle between Jerusalem and Ramallah to meet with senior advisers to the leaders of both sides and then leave after just a few days. In an interview with Newsweek last month, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas openly accused Mitchell of not doing his job. "Every visit by Mitchell, we talked to him and gave him some ideas," he said. "At the end we discovered that he didn't convey any of these ideas to the Israelis. What does it mean?"


A politically attuned man who was once Senate Majority Leader, Mitchell was aware of the complaints about him. His usual comeback was to point to his success in Northern Ireland, which earned him the Presidential Medal of Freedom. For hundreds of days, he liked to say, he was considered a failure, until the final day, when he actually got it done.


Mitchell's resignation letter set off a small panic inside the West Wing earlier in the week. Senior advisers, as well as Obama himself, could sense the increasing difficulty of the job: Administration officials had been unable to convince Israel to halve new settlements in the West Bank, alienating Palestinians, and Israelis were irked in early May when Abbas allied with Hamas, a group that refuses to denounce violence against Israel. But the symbolism of Mitchell leaving several days before Obama's biggest week of outreach to the region projected a vacuum of confidence that anything hopeful, however remote, was on the horizon.


"He wouldn't be leaving at this important hour if he knew there was going to be a significant change in the administration's attitude toward the peace process," said Middle East analyst Gregory Orfalea, who formerly taught at Georgetown's School of Foreign Service. "He's leaving because it's status quo."


Mitchell will be replaced—in the interim by his deputy, David Hale—and another official will take a crack at the quandary. But despite new momentum from Netanyahu's visit next week and Obama's speech Thursday, Mitchell's departure could signal stagnant talks for the next several years. According to Fawaz Gerges, director of the London School of Economics' Middle East Center, "the reality is that, with Mitchell leaving, Barack Obama basically lost the ideological battle [over how to confront the peace process]. By now he'll have to wait for the second term before you can get another concerted effort."

Amid the Arab Spring, a U.S.-Saudi split


Nawaf Obaid





May 16 - RIYADH, SAUDI ARABIA -- A tectonic shift has occurred in the U.S.-Saudi relationship. Despite significant pressure from the Obama administration to remain on the sidelines, Saudi leaders sent troops into Manama in March to defend Bahrain’s monarchy and quell the unrest that has shaken that country since February. For more than 60 years, Saudi Arabia has been bound by an unwritten bargain: oil for security. Riyadh has often protested but ultimately acquiesced to what it saw as misguided U.S. policies. But American missteps in the region since Sept. 11, an ill-conceived response to the Arab protest movements and an unconscionable refusal to hold Israel accountable for its illegal settlement building have brought this arrangement to an end. As the Saudis recalibrate the partnership, Riyadh intends to pursue a much more assertive foreign policy, at times conflicting with American interests. The backdrop for this change are the rise of Iranian meddling in the region and the counterproductive policies that the United States has pursued here since Sept. 11. The most significant blunder may have been the invasion of Iraq, which resulted in enormous loss of life and provided Iran an opening to expand its sphere of influence. For years, Iran’s leadership has aimed to foment discord while furthering its geopolitical ambitions. Tehran has long funded Hamas and Hezbollah; recently, its scope of attempted interference has broadened to include the affairs of Arab states from Yemen to Morocco. This month the chief of staff of Iran’s armed forces, Gen. Hasan Firouzabadi, harshly criticized Riyadh over its intervention in Bahrain, claiming this act would spark massive domestic uprisings.


Such remarks are based more on wishful thinking than fact, but Iran’s efforts to destabilize its neighbors are tireless. As Riyadh fights a cold war with Tehran, Washington has shown itself in recent months to be an unwilling and unreliable partner against this threat. The emerging political reality is a Saudi-led Arab world facing off against the aggression of Iran and its non-state proxies. Saudi Arabia will not allow the political unrest in the region to destabilize the Arab monarchies — the Gulf states, Jordan and Morocco. In Yemen, the Saudis are insisting on an orderly transition of power and a dignified exit for President Ali Abdullah Saleh (a courtesy that was not extended to Hosni Mubarak, despite the former Egyptian president’s many years as a strong U.S. ally). To facilitate this handover, Riyadh is leading a diplomatic effort under the auspices of the six-country Gulf Cooperation Council. In Iraq, the Saudi government will continue to pursue a hard-line stance against the Maliki government, which it regards as little more than an Iranian puppet. In Lebanon, Saudi Arabia will act to check the growth of Hezbollah and to ensure that this Iranian proxy does not dominate the country’s political life. Regarding the widespread upheaval in Syria, the Saudis will work to ensure that any potential transition to a post-Assad era is as peaceful and as free of Iranian meddling as possible.  Regarding Israel, Riyadh is adamant that a just settlement, based on King Abdullah’s proposed peace plan, be implemented. This includes a Palestinian state with its capital in East Jerusalem. The United States has lost all credibility on this issue; after casting the sole vote in the U.N. Security Council against censuring Israel for its illegal settlement building, it can no longer act as an objective mediator. This act was a watershed in U.S.-Saudi relations, guaranteeing that Saudi leaders will not push for further compromise from the Palestinians, despite American pressure.


Saudi Arabia remains strong and stable, lending muscle to its invigorated foreign policy. Spiritually, the kingdom plays a unique role for the world’s 1.2 billion Muslims — more than 1 billion of whom are Sunni — as the birthplace of Islam and home of the two holiest cities. Politically, its leaders enjoy broad domestic support, and a growing nationalism has knitted the historically tribal country more closely together. This is largely why widespread protests, much anticipated by Western media in March, never materialized. As the world’s sole energy superpower and the de facto central banker of the global energy markets, Riyadh is the economic powerhouse of the Middle East, representing 25 percent of the combined gross domestic product of the Arab world. The kingdom has amassed more than $550 billion in foreign reserves and is spending more than $150 billion to improve infrastructure, public education, social services and health care.  To counter the threats posed by Iran and transnational terrorist networks, the Saudi leadership is authorizing more than $100 billion of additional military spending to modernize ground forces, upgrade naval capabilities and more. The kingdom is doubling its number of high-quality combat aircraft and adding 60,000 security personnel to the Interior Ministry forces. Plans are underway to create a “Special Forces Command,” based on the U.S. model, to unify the kingdom’s various special forces if needed for rapid deployment abroad. Saudi Arabia has the will and the means to meet its expanded global responsibilities. In some issues, such as counterterrorism and efforts to fight money laundering, the Saudis will continue to be a strong U.S. partner. In areas in which Saudi national security or strategic interests are at stake, the kingdom will pursue its own agenda. With Iran working tirelessly to dominate the region, the Muslim Brotherhood rising in Egypt and unrest on nearly every border, there is simply too much at stake for the kingdom to rely on a security policy written in Washington, which has backfired more often than not and spread instability. The special relationship may never be the same, but from this transformation a more stable and secure Middle East can be born.

Dr. K’s Rx for China


Niall Ferguson





May 15, 2011  -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton thinks the Chinese government is “scared” of the Arab Spring. “They’re worried,” she told Jeffrey Goldberg in the latest Atlantic, “and they are trying to stop history, which is a fool’s errand. They cannot do it.”


These are words—intemperate, undiplomatic, and very likely counterproductive—that you cannot imagine being uttered by her predecessor Henry Kissinger. It is now 40 years since Kissinger went on his secret mission to China, to pave the way for President Richard Nixon’s historic visit the following year. Since then he has visited the country more than 50 times. And if there is one thing he has learned, it is this: the real fool’s errand is to lean on the Chinese. Much has changed in the world since Kissinger’s first trip to China. (In 1971, who would have dared to predict that America’s public enemy No. 1 would be a Saudi-born Islamic fundamentalist skulking in a walled compound in Pakistan?) But at least two things in American foreign policy remain consistent: the relationship with mainland China, revived by Kissinger after more than 20 years in the deep freeze, and Kissinger himself, consulted formally or informally by every president from John F. Kennedy to Barack Obama. On China, Kissinger’s new book, is a reminder of why our leaders still want to pick his brains. Eighty-eight years old this month, he remains without equal as a strategic thinker.  The opening to China is a story Kissinger has told before: how he and Nixon had discerned that country could become a strategic counterweight to the Soviet Union; how he secretly flew to China after feigning illness in Pakistan; how he and Premier Zhou Enlai hammered out the diplomatic basis for Nixon’s official visit (the Shanghai Communiqué). The result was, as he puts it, “a quasi alliance,” which, though initially intended to contain the Soviet Union, ended up outliving the Cold War.


In this telling, however, Kissinger is able to take advantage of recent research that illuminates the Chinese side of the story. The American opening to China was also a Chinese opening to America, actuated above all by Mao Zedong’s fear of encirclement. “Think about this,” Mao told his doctor in 1969. “We have the Soviet Union to the north and the west, India to the south, and Japan to the east. If all our enemies were to unite, attacking us from the north, south, east, and west, what do you think we should do?” The medic had no idea. “Think again,” said Mao. “Beyond Japan is the United States. Didn’t our ancestors counsel negotiating with faraway countries while fighting with those that are near?” It was to explore the American option that Mao recalled four Army marshals from exile. Skirmishes were already underway between Soviet and Chinese forces on the Ussuri River. In October 1970 Mao ordered China’s top leadership to evacuate Beijing and put the People’s Liberation Army on “first-degree combat readiness.” The stakes for China were high indeed—higher than for the United States.  As Kissinger shows, it was far from unusual for Mao to refer to “our ancestors’ counsel.” Despite his lifelong commitment to Marxism-Leninism, Mao was also steeped in the classics of Chinese civilization, as were his close advisers. “We can consult the example of Zhuge Liang’s strategic guiding principle,” Marshal Ye Jian-ying suggested, “when the three states of Wei, Shu, and Wu confronted each other: ‘Ally with Wu in the east to oppose Wei in the north.’ ” The allusion, Kissinger explains, is to Romance of the Three Kingdoms, a 14th-century epic novel set in the so-called Warring States period (475–221 B.C.).


Nor was this the only occasion when China’s communist leaders looked to the distant past for inspiration. Of equal importance to them, Kissinger argues, was The Art of War by Sun Tzu, which dates from the even earlier Spring and Autumn period (770–476 B.C.). “The victorious army/Is victorious first/And seeks battle later”: axioms like this one encouraged Chinese strategists to think of international relations like the board game Weiqi (known in the West as Go), a “game of surrounding pieces.”   Mao shared with China’s prerevolutionary leaders an assumption that China is not like other countries. With a population that amounts to a fifth of humanity, it is Zhongguo: the Middle Kingdom or, perhaps more accurately, the “Central Country.” At times it could even seem like tian xia: “all under heaven.” The best foreign policy for such an empire was to “let barbarians fight barbarians.” If that failed, then the strongest of the barbarians should be embraced and civilized (as happened to the Manchus).   “Domineering and overwhelming … ruthless and aloof, poet and warrior, prophet and scourge”—Mao’s true hero was not Lenin but the tyrannical, book-burning “first emperor,” Qin Shi Huang, who united China in 221 B.C. In a similar way, Kissinger shows, the current generation of Chinese leaders have drawn inspiration from the teachings of Kong Fu Zi (known in the West as Confucius). Their goal, he argues, is not world domination but da tong: “great harmony.”   This goes to the heart of the matter. In 1971, when Kissinger first went to China, the U.S. economy was roughly five times that of the People’s Republic. Forty years later, as a result of the industrial revolution unleashed by Mao’s successor Deng Xiao-ping, it is conceivable that China could overtake America within a decade. This is a feat the Soviet Union never came close to achieving. Moreover, China is now the biggest foreign holder of U.S. Treasury notes, which form an important part of its vast $3 trillion of international reserves. How China will use its newfound economic power may be the most important question of our time. Few Americans are better placed to answer that question than Kissinger, who has dealt with four generations of Chinese leaders.


The most profound insights of On China are psychological. They concern the fundamental cultural differences between a Chinese elite who can look back more than two millennia for inspiration and an American elite whose historical frame of reference is little more than two centuries old. This became most obvious in the wake of June 1989, when Americans recoiled from the use of military force to end the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy demonstrations. To Kissinger’s eyes, it was doubly naive to retaliate to this crackdown with sanctions: “Western concepts of human rights and individual liberties may not be directly translatable … to a civilization for millennia ordered around different concepts. Nor can the traditional Chinese fear of political chaos be dismissed as an anachronistic irrelevancy needing only ‘correction’ by Western enlightenment.”


As China’s first Anglophone leader, Jiang Zemin, explained to Kissinger in 1991: “We never submit to pressure … It is a philosophical principle.”   The United States and China went to war in Korea because of another cultural gap. It came as a surprise to the Americans when Mao ordered Chinese intervention because the military odds looked so unfavorable. But, argues Kissinger, his “motivating force was less to inflict a decisive military first blow than to change the psychological balance, not so much to defeat the enemy as to alter his calculus of risks.” Mao was a master of the ancient Empty City Stratagem, which seeks to conceal weakness with a show of confidence, even aggression. To Westerners, his insistence that he did not fear a nuclear attack seemed unhinged or, at best, callous (“We may lose more than 300 million people. So what? War is war. The years will pass, and we’ll get to work producing more babies than ever before”). But this was classical Chinese bravado, or “offensive deterrence.”    “Chinese negotiators,” observes Kissinger in a passage that should be inwardly digested not just by American diplomats but also by American businessmen before they land in Beijing, “use diplomacy to weave together political, military, and psychological elements into an overall strategic design.” American diplomacy, by contrast, “generally prefers …c to be ‘flexible’; it feels an obligation to break deadlocks with new proposals—unintentionally inviting new deadlocks to elicit new proposals.” We could learn a thing or two from the Chinese, Kissinger implies, particularly Sun Tzu’s concept of shi, meaning the “potential energy” of the overall strategic landscape. Our tendency is to have an agenda of 10 different points, each one to be dealt with separately. They have one big game plan. We are always in a hurry for closure, anxiously watching the minutes tick away. The Chinese value patience; as Mao explained to Kissinger, they measure time in millennia.


Such fundamental cultural differences may give rise to conflict with China in the future, Kissinger warns: “When the Chinese view of preemption encounters the Western concept of deterrence, a vicious circle can result: acts conceived as defensive in China may be treated as aggressive by the outside world; deterrent moves by the West may be interpreted in China as encirclement. The United States and China wrestled with this dilemma repeatedly during the Cold War; to some extent they have not yet found a way to transcend it.”


Could the United States and the People’s Republic come to blows again? The possibility cannot be excluded. As Kissinger reminds us, war was the result when Germany rose to challenge Britain economically and geopolitically 100 years ago. Moreover, the key factor that brought America and China together in the 1970s—the common Soviet enemy the Chinese called “the polar bear”—has vanished from the scene. Old, intractable differences persist over Taiwan and North Korea. What remains is “Chimerica,” a less-than-happy marriage of economic convenience in which one partner does all the saving and the other does all the spending.


In Kissinger’s own words, China’s rise could “make international relations bipolar again,” ushering in a new cold (or possibly even hot) war. Nationalist writers like Liu Mingfu, author of China Dream, urge China to switch from “peaceful development” to “military rise” and look forward to the “duel of the century” with the United States. There are those in Washington, too—apparently including, for the moment, the Obama administration—who would relish a more confrontational relationship.   Yet Kissinger remains hopeful that cooler heads will prevail in Beijing: thinkers like Zheng Bijian, who urges China to “transcend the traditional ways for great powers to emerge” and “not [to] follow the path of Germany leading up to World War I.” Rather than attempting to “organize Asia on the basis of containing China or creating a bloc of democratic states for an ideological crusade,” the United States would do better, Kissinger suggests, to work with China to build a new “Pacific Community.”


Four decades ago, Richard Nixon grasped sooner than most the huge potential of China. “Well,” he mused, “you can just stop and think of what could happen if anybody with a decent system of government got control of that mainland. Good God … There’d be no power in the world that could even—I mean, you put 800 million Chinese to work under a decent system … and they will be the leaders of the world.” That prophecy is being fulfilled in our time. The fact that until now China’s rise has been a boon to the United States rather than a bane owes much to the work of Henry Kissinger. With this book he has given his successors an indispensable guide to continuing the Sino-American “coevolution” he began.

Syria as Turkey’s domestic issue


Yusuf Kanli

May 15, 2011 -- Syria is no Libya for many reasons; not just because it is a country right on the Turkish border or, like Turkey, it has a Kurdish population and an explosion there may ignite an explosion on this side of the border as well.


Like a broken watch that shows correct time twice a day, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan as well occasionally makes some correct analysis. Last week, while comparing the uprising in Libya against the Moammar Gadhafi regime and the growing unrest in the Syrian street against the Baathist regime of Bashar al-Assad, the prime minister correctly said Libya and Syria were two totally different issues for Turkey.


Erdoğan explained while Turkey was very much concerned with what’s happening in Libya and have been undertaking every possible effort to contribute to a quick end to the tumult and restoration of peace and order in Libya, Syria was very much like a domestic incident for Turkey.


As part of its neo-Ottoman drive to enhance its influence in the Middle Eastern territory of the former Ottoman Empire the ruling Justice and development Party, or AKP, government of Turkey has long waived visa requirement in travel between Turkey and Syria. The aim behind that move was to plant the seeds of a future European Union-like Middle Eastern union led by Turkey but the first tangible result was not a marked increase in commercial, business or tourist interactions, but a batch of 250 refugees running from the fire on the Syrian street.


If the problem continues and escalates further in the Syrian street it is probable that the prefabricated facility in the Hatay province constructed to provide temporary lodging to pilgrims during the Hajj season will not suffice in providing a shelter to Syrian refugees who thanks to the no-visa regime in travel between Turkey and Syria may freely escape to Turkey from the trouble in their own street and thus carry the problem to the Turkish street.


For now the separatist Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, terrorists are abiding with an unilateral truce, which is claimed to have been negotiated with the government by Abdullah Öcalan, the chieftain of the gang serving an enforced life term on the İmralı island prison, which according to claims will last until June 15, three days after the June 12 parliamentary elections. Indeed, excluding some rehearsal for a possible mass civilian disobedience campaign after the elections and some exceptional terrorist acts, it might be said that there is nothing extraordinary in Turkey’s southeast bordering Syria, Iraq and Iran, where there are sizeable Kurdish populations.


The “success” of the unrest in Syrian streets in uprooting the government might mean added trouble for Turkey, which has been battling with separatist terrorism for the past 25 years. Turkey remaining silent or supportive of the Assad regime crushing the pressure for a regime change and reform calls of the Syrian street, on the other hand, would seriously imperil the regional role aspired by the AKP governance of Turkey.


Indeed, while the AKP government in Ankara joined the calls of the U.S.-led coalition of the willing that time is up for Moammar Gadhafi in Libya and for peace and safety of his own people Gadhafi must step down, as regards to Syria Ankara, as well as the Western alliance, has been restraining their calls with a shy request from Assad to accelerate reforms.


While Ankara may answer anti-Turkish demonstrations in Libya by closing down the Turkish embassy in Tripoli, the first ever such action by the diplomatic service throughout its modern history, anti-Turkish demonstrations in Damascus can be really costly for Turkey now and in the future.


While the personal friendly relations between Assad and his counterpart in Turkey, Erdoğan, might provide Turkey a golden opportunity to help Syria sail out of the current tumultuous situation. Of course at a time when Erdoğan himself is after converting Turkey into his sultanate of fear under the aegis of advanced democracy it might be absurd to expect him to advise Assad of a democratic way out of the mess in Syria. Yet, as much as Turkey needs to see restoration of peace, security and stability in Syria for domestic security reasons as well as for its regional role, Syria and President Assad need Turkey and Erdoğan to walk the extra mile in reforms advised by them, as the real-politic of the day compels him to do so if he wants to sail out of this problem in one piece.


If, however, despite Turkey’s democracy and reform preaches, the massacres continue in the Syrian street not only the prestige of Erdoğan in the Arab street will be seriously impaired but sooner or later the fire in the Arab street will have a reflection on the Turkish streets.

STRATFOR


The Geopolitics of Israel: Biblical and Modern 





The founding principle of geopolitics is that place — geography — plays a significant role in determining how nations will behave. If that theory is true, then there ought to be a deep continuity in a nation's foreign policy. Israel is a laboratory for this theory, since it has existed in three different manifestations in roughly the same place, twice in antiquity and once in modernity. If geopolitics is correct, then Israeli foreign policy, independent of policymakers, technology or the identity of neighbors, ought to have important common features. This is, therefore, a discussion of common principles in Israeli foreign policy over nearly 3,000 years. 
For convenience, we will use the term "Israel" to connote all of the Hebrew and Jewish entities that have existed in the Levant since the invasion of the region as chronicled in the Book of Joshua. As always, geopolitics requires a consideration of three dimensions: the internal geopolitics of Israel, the interaction of Israel and the immediate neighbors who share borders with it, and Israel's interaction with what we will call great powers, beyond Israel's borderlands. 
Israel has manifested itself three times in history. The first manifestation began with the invasion led by Joshua and lasted through its division into two kingdoms, the Babylonian conquest of the Kingdom of Judah and the deportation to Babylon early in the sixth century B.C. The second manifestation began when Israel was recreated in 540 B.C. by the Persians, who had defeated the Babylonians. The nature of this second manifestation changed in the fourth century B.C., when Greece overran the Persian Empire and Israel, and again in the first century B.C., when the Romans conquered the region. 
The second manifestation saw Israel as a small actor within the framework of larger imperial powers, a situation that lasted until the destruction of the Jewish vassal state by the Romans. 
Israel's third manifestation began in 1948, following (as in the other cases) an ingathering of t least some of the Jews who had been dispersed after conquests. Israel's founding takes place in the context of the decline and fall of the British Empire and must, at least in part, be understood as part of British imperial history. 
During its first 50 years, Israel plays a pivotal role in the confrontation of the United States and the Soviet Union and, in some senses, is hostage to the dynamics of these two countries. In other words, like the first two manifestations of Israel, the third finds Israel continually struggling among independence, internal tension and imperial ambition.
Israeli Geography and Borderlands 
At its height, under King David, Israel extended from the Sinai to the Euphrates, encompassing Damascus. It occupied some, but relatively little, of the coastal region, an area beginning at what today is Haifa and running south to Jaffa, just north of today's Tel Aviv. The coastal area to the north was held by Phoenicia, the area to the south by Philistines. It is essential to understand that Israel's size and shape shifted over time. For example, Judah under the Hasmoneans did not include the Negev but did include the Golan. The general locale of Israel is fixed. Its precise borders have never been.
Thus, it is perhaps better to begin with what never was part of Israel. Israel never included the Sinai Peninsula. Along the coast, it never stretched much farther north than the Litani River in today's Lebanon. Apart from David's extreme extension (and fairly tenuous control) to the north, Israel's territory never stretched as far as Damascus, although it frequently held the Golan Heights. Israel extended many times to both sides of the Jordan but never deep into the Jordanian Desert. It never extended southeast into the Arabian Peninsula. 
Israel consists generally of three parts. First, it always has had the northern hill region, stretching from the foothills of Mount Hermon south to Jerusalem. Second, it always contains some of the coastal plain from today's Tel Aviv north to Haifa. Third, it occupies area between Jerusalem and the Jordan River — today's West Bank. At times, it controls all or part of the Negev, including the coastal region between the Sinai to the Tel Aviv area. It may be larger than this at various times in history, and sometimes smaller, but it normally holds all or part of these three regions. 
Israel is well-buffered in three directions. The Sinai Desert protects it against the Egyptians. In general, the Sinai has held little attraction for the Egyptians. The difficulty of deploying forces in the eastern Sinai poses severe logistical problems for them, particularly during a prolonged presence. Unless Egypt can rapidly move through the Sinai north into the coastal plain, where it can sustain its forces more readily, deploying in the Sinai is difficult and unrewarding. Therefore, so long as Israel is not so weak as to make an attack on the coastal plain a viable option, or unless Egypt is motivated by an outside imperial power, Israel does not face a threat from the southwest. 
Israel is similarly protected from the southeast. The deserts southeast of Eilat-Aqaba are virtually impassable. No large force could approach from that direction, although smaller raiding parties could. The tribes of the Arabian Peninsula lack the reach or the size to pose a threat to Israel, unless massed and aligned with other forces. Even then, the approach from the southeast is not one that they are likely to take. The Negev is secure from that direction. 
The eastern approaches are similarly secured by desert, which begins about 20 to 30 miles east of the Jordan River. While indigenous forces exist in the borderland east of the Jordan, they lack the numbers to be able to penetrate decisively west of the Jordan. Indeed, the normal model is that, so long as Israel controls Judea and Samaria (the modern-day West Bank), then the East Bank of the Jordan River is under the political and sometimes military domination of Israel — sometimes directly through settlement, sometimes indirectly through political influence, or economic or security leverage. 
Israel's vulnerability is in the north. There is no natural buffer between Phoenicia and its successor entities (today's Lebanon) to the direct north. The best defense line for Israel in the north is the Litani River, but this is not an insurmountable boundary under any circumstance. However, the area along the coast north of Israel does not present a serious threat. The coastal area prospers through trade in the Mediterranean basin. It is oriented toward the sea and to the trade routes to the east, not to the south. If it does anything, this area protects those trade routes and has no appetite for a conflict that might disrupt trade. It stays out of Israel's way, for the most part. 
Moreover, as a commercial area, this region is generally wealthy, a factor that increases predators around it and social conflict within. It is an area prone to instability. Israel frequently tries to extend its influence northward for commercial reasons, as one of the predators, and this can entangle Israel in its regional politics. But barring this self-induced problem, the threat to Israel from the north is minimal, despite the absence of natural boundaries and the large population. On occasion, there is spillover of conflicts from the north, but not to a degree that might threaten regime survival in Israel. 
The neighbor that is always a threat lies to the northeast. Syria — or, more precisely, the area governed by Damascus at any time — is populous and frequently has no direct outlet to the sea. It is, therefore, generally poor. The area to its north, Asia Minor, is heavily mountainous. Syria cannot project power to the north except with great difficulty, but powers in Asia Minor can move south. Syria's eastern flank is buffered by a desert that stretches to the Euphrates. Therefore, when there is no threat from the north, Syria's interest — after securing itself internally — is to gain access to the coast. Its primary channel is directly westward, toward the rich cities of the northern Levantine coast, with which it trades heavily. An alternative interest is southwestward, toward the southern Levantine coast controlled by Israel. 
As can be seen, Syria can be interested in Israel only selectively. When it is interested, it has a serious battle problem. To attack Israel, it would have to strike between Mount Hermon and the Sea of Galilee, an area about 25 miles wide. The Syrians potentially can attack south of the sea, but only if they are prepared to fight through this region and then attack on extended supply lines. If an attack is mounted along the main route, Syrian forces must descend the Golan Heights and then fight through the hilly Galilee before reaching the coastal plain — sometimes with guerrillas holding out in the Galilean hills. The Galilee is an area that is relatively easy to defend and difficult to attack. Therefore, it is only once Syria takes the Galilee, and can control its lines of supply against guerrilla attack, that its real battle begins. 
To reach the coast or move toward Jerusalem, Syria must fight through a plain in front of a line of low hills. This is the decisive battleground where massed Israeli forces, close to lines of supply, can defend against dispersed Syrian forces on extended lines of supply. It is no accident that Megiddo — or Armageddon, as the plain is sometimes referred to — has apocalyptic meaning. This is the point at which any move from Syria would be decided. But a Syrian offensive would have a tough fight to reach Megiddo, and a tougher one as it deploys on the plain. 
On the surface, Israel lacks strategic depth, but this is true only on the surface. It faces limited threats from southern neighbors. To its east, it faces only a narrow strip of populated area east of the Jordan. To the north, there is a maritime commercial entity. Syria operating alone, forced through the narrow gap of the Mount Hermon-Galilee line and operating on extended supply lines, can be dealt with readily. 
There is a risk of simultaneous attacks from multiple directions. Depending on the forces deployed and the degree of coordination between them, this can pose a problem for Israel. However, even here the Israelis have the tremendous advantage of fighting on interior lines. Egypt and Syria, fighting on external lines (and widely separated fronts), would have enormous difficulty transferring forces from one front to another. Israel, on interior lines (fronts close to each other with good transportation), would be able to move its forces from front to front rapidly, allowing for sequential engagement and thereby the defeat of enemies. Unless enemies are carefully coordinated and initiate war simultaneously — and deploy substantially superior force on at least one front — Israel can initiate war at a time of its choosing or else move its forces rapidly between fronts, negating much of the advantage of size that the attackers might have. 
There is another aspect to the problem of multifront war. Egypt usually has minimal interests along the Levant, having its own coast and an orientation to the south toward the headwaters of the Nile. On the rare occasions when Egypt does move through the Sinai and attacks to the north and northeast, it is in an expansionary mode. By the time it consolidates and exploits the coastal plain, it would be powerful enough to threaten Syria. From Syria's point of view, the only thing more dangerous than Israel is an Egypt in control of Israel. Therefore, the probability of a coordinated north-south strike at Israel is rare, is rarely coordinated and usually is not designed to be a mortal blow. It is defeated by Israel's strategic advantage of interior lines. 
Israeli Geography and the Convergence Zone
Therefore, it is not surprising that Israel's first incarnation lasted as long as it did — some five centuries. What is interesting and what must be considered is why Israel (now considered as the northern kingdom) was defeated by the Assyrians and Judea, then defeated by Babylon. To understand this, we need to consider the broader geography of Israel's location. 
Israel is located on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea, on the Levant. As we have seen, when Israel is intact, it will tend to be the dominant power in the Levant. Therefore, Israeli resources must generally be dedicated for land warfare, leaving little over for naval warfare. In general, although Israel had excellent harbors and access to wood for shipbuilding, it never was a major Mediterranean naval power. It never projected power into the sea. The area to the north of Israel has always been a maritime power, but Israel, the area south of Mount Hermon, was always forced to be a land power. 
The Levant in general and Israel in particular has always been a magnet for great powers. No Mediterranean empire could be fully secure unless it controlled the Levant. Whether it was Rome or Carthage, a Mediterranean empire that wanted to control both the northern and southern littorals needed to anchor its eastern flank on the Levant. For one thing, without the Levant, a Mediterranean power would be entirely dependent on sea lanes for controlling the other shore. Moving troops solely by sea creates transport limitations and logistical problems. It also leaves imperial lines vulnerable to interdiction — sometimes merely from pirates, a problem that plagued Rome's sea transport. A land bridge, or a land bridge with minimal water crossings that can be easily defended, is a vital supplement to the sea for the movement of large numbers of troops. Once the Hellespont is crossed, the coastal route through southern Turkey, down the Levant and along the Mediterranean's southern shore, provides such an alternative. 
There is an additional consideration. If a Mediterranean empire leaves the Levant unoccupied, it opens the door to the possibility of a great power originating to the east seizing the ports of the Levant and challenging the Mediterranean power for maritime domination. In short, control of the Levant binds a Mediterranean empire together while denying a challenger from the east the opportunity to enter the Mediterranean. Holding the Levant, and controlling Israel, is a necessary preventive measure for a Mediterranean empire. 
Israel is also important to any empire originating to the east of Israel, either in the Tigris-Euphrates basin or in Persia. For either, security could be assured only once it had an anchor on the Levant. Macedonian expansion under Alexander demonstrated that a power controlling Levantine and Turkish ports could support aggressive operations far to the east, to the Hindu Kush and beyond. While Turkish ports might have sufficed for offensive operations, simply securing the Bosporus still left the southern flank exposed. Therefore, by holding the Levant, an eastern power protected itself against attacks from Mediterranean powers. 
The Levant was also important to any empire originating to the north or south of Israel. If Egypt decided to move beyond the Nile Basin and North Africa eastward, it would move first through the Sinai and then northward along the coastal plain, securing sea lanes to Egypt. When Asia Minor powers such as the Ottoman Empire developed, there was a natural tendency to move southward to control the eastern Mediterranean. The Levant is the crossroads of continents, and Israel lies in the path of many imperial ambitions. 
Israel therefore occupies what might be called the convergence zone of the Eastern Hemisphere. A European power trying to dominate the Mediterranean or expand eastward, an eastern power trying to dominate the space between the Hindu Kush and the Mediterranean, a North African power moving toward the east, or a northern power moving south — all must converge on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean and therefore on Israel. Of these, the European power and the eastern power must be the most concerned with Israel. For either, there is no choice but to secure it as an anchor.
Internal Geopolitics 
Israel is geographically divided into three regions, which traditionally have produced three different types of people. Its coastal plain facilitates commerce, serving as the interface between eastern trade routes and the sea. It is the home of merchants and manufacturers, cosmopolitans — not as cosmopolitan as Phoenicia or Lebanon, but cosmopolitan for Israel. The northeast is hill country, closest to the unruliness north of the Litani River and to the Syrian threat. It breeds farmers and warriors. The area south of Jerusalem is hard desert country, more conducive to herdsman and warriors than anything else. Jerusalem is where these three regions are balanced and governed. 
There are obviously deep differences built into Israel's geography and inhabitants, particularly between the herdsmen of the southern deserts and the northern hill dwellers. The coastal dwellers, rich but less warlike than the others, hold the balance or are the prize to be pursued. In the division of the original kingdom between Israel and Judea, we saw the alliance of the coast with the Galilee, while Jerusalem was held by the desert dwellers. The consequence of the division was that Israel in the north ultimately was conquered by Assyrians from the northeast, while Babylon was able to swallow Judea. 
Social divisions in Israel obviously do not have to follow geographical lines. However, over time, these divisions must manifest themselves. For example, the coastal plain is inherently more cosmopolitan than the rest of the country. The interests of its inhabitants lie more with trading partners in the Mediterranean and the rest of the world than with their countrymen. Their standard of living is higher, and their commitment to traditions is lower. Therefore, there is an inherent tension between their immediate interests and those of the Galileans, who live more precarious, warlike lives. Countries can be divided over lesser issues — and when Israel is divided, it is vulnerable even to regional threats. 
We say "even" because geography dictates that regional threats are less menacing than might be expected. The fact that Israel would be outnumbered demographically should all its neighbors turn on it is less important than the fact that it has adequate buffers in most directions, that the ability of neighbors to coordinate an attack is minimal and that their appetite for such an attack is even less. The single threat that Israel faces from the northeast can readily be managed if the Israelis create a united front there. When Israel was overrun by a Damascus-based power, it was deeply divided internally. 
It is important to add one consideration to our discussion of buffers, which is diplomacy. The main neighbors of Israel are Egyptians, Syrians and those who live on the east bank of Jordan. This last group is a negligible force demographically, and the interests of the Syrians and Egyptians are widely divergent. Egypt's interests are to the south and west of its territory; the Sinai holds no attraction. Syria is always threatened from multiple directions, and alliance with Egypt adds little to its security. Therefore, under the worst of circumstances, Egypt and Syria have difficulty supporting each other. Under the best of circumstances, from Israel's point of view, it can reach a political accommodation with Egypt, securing its southwestern frontier politically as well as by geography, thus freeing Israel to concentrate on the northern threats and opportunities.
Israel and the Great Powers 
The threat to Israel rarely comes from the region, except when the Israelis are divided internally. The conquests of Israel occur when powers not adjacent to it begin forming empires. Babylon, Persia, Macedonia, Rome, Turkey and Britain all controlled Israel politically, sometimes for worse and sometimes for better. Each dominated it militarily, but none was a neighbor of Israel. This is a consistent pattern. Israel can resist its neighbors; danger arises when more distant powers begin playing imperial games. Empires can bring force to bear that Israel cannot resist. 
Israel therefore has this problem: It would be secure if it could confine itself to protecting its interests from neighbors, but it cannot confine itself because its geographic location invariably draws larger, more distant powers toward Israel. Therefore, while Israel's military can focus only on immediate interests, its diplomatic interests must look much further. Israel is constantly entangled with global interests (as the globe is defined at any point), seeking to deflect and align with broader global powers. When it fails in this diplomacy, the consequences can be catastrophic. 
Israel exists in three conditions. First, it can be a completely independent state. This condition occurs when there are no major imperial powers external to the region. We might call this the David model. Second, it can live as part of an imperial system — either as a subordinate ally, as a moderately autonomous entity or as a satrapy. In any case, it maintains its identity but loses room for independent maneuvering in foreign policy and potentially in domestic policy. We might call this the Persian model in its most beneficent form. Finally, Israel can be completely crushed — with mass deportations and migrations, with a complete loss of autonomy and minimal residual autonomy. We might call this the Babylonian model. 
The Davidic model exists primarily when there is no external imperial power needing control of the Levant that is in a position either to send direct force or to support surrogates in the immediate region. The Persian model exists when Israel aligns itself with the foreign policy interests of such an imperial power, to its own benefit. The Babylonian model exists when Israel miscalculates on the broader balance of power and attempts to resist an emerging hegemon. When we look at Israeli behavior over time, the periods when Israel does not confront hegemonic powers outside the region are not rare, but are far less common than when it is confronting them. 
Given the period of the first iteration of Israel, it would be too much to say that the Davidic model rarely comes into play, but certainly since that time, variations of the Persian and Babylonian models have dominated. The reason is geographic. Israel is normally of interest to outside powers because of its strategic position. While Israel can deal with local challenges effectively, it cannot deal with broader challenges. It lacks the economic or military weight to resist. Therefore, it is normally in the process of managing broader threats or collapsing because of them. 
The Geopolitics of Contemporary Israel
Let us then turn to the contemporary manifestation of Israel. Israel was recreated because of the interaction between a regional great power, the Ottoman Empire, and a global power, Great Britain. During its expansionary phase, the Ottoman Empire sought to dominate the eastern Mediterranean as well as both its northern and southern coasts. One thrust went through the Balkans toward central Europe. The other was toward Egypt. Inevitably, this required that the Ottomans secure the Levant. 
For the British, the focus on the eastern Mediterranean was as the primary sea lane to India. As such, Gibraltar and the Suez were crucial. The importance of the Suez was such that the presence of a hostile, major naval force in the eastern Mediterranean represented a direct threat to British interests. It followed that defeating the Ottoman Empire during World War I and breaking its residual naval power was critical. The British, as was shown at Gallipoli, lacked the resources to break the Ottoman Empire by main force. They resorted to a series of alliances with local forces to undermine the Ottomans. One was an alliance with Bedouin tribes in the Arabian Peninsula; others involved covert agreements with anti-Turkish, Arab interests from the Levant to the Persian Gulf. A third, minor thrust was aligning with Jewish interests globally, particularly those interested in the refounding of Israel. Britain had little interest in this goal, but saw such discussions as part of the process of destabilizing the Ottomans. 
The strategy worked. Under an agreement with France, the Ottoman province of Syria was divided into two parts on a line roughly running east-west between the sea and Mount Hermon. The northern part was given to France and divided into Lebanon and a rump Syria entity. The southern part was given to Britain and was called Palestine, after the Ottoman administrative district Filistina. Given the complex politics of the Arabian Peninsula, the British had to find a home for a group of Hashemites, which they located on the east bank of the Jordan River and designated, for want of a better name, the Trans-Jordan — the other side of the Jordan. Palestine looked very much like traditional Israel. 
The ideological foundations of Zionism are not our concern here, nor are the pre- and post-World War II migrations of Jews, although those are certainly critical. What is important for purposes of this analysis are two things: First, the British emerged economically and militarily crippled from World War II and unable to retain their global empire, Palestine included. Second, the two global powers that emerged after World War II — the United States and the Soviet Union — were engaged in an intense struggle for the eastern Mediterranean after World War II, as can be seen in the Greek and Turkish issues at that time. Neither wanted to see the British Empire survive, each wanted the Levant, and neither was prepared to make a decisive move to take it. 
Both the United States and the Soviet Union saw the re-creation of Israel as an opportunity to introduce their power to the Levant. The Soviets thought they might have some influence over Israel due to ideology. The Americans thought they might have some influence given the role of American Jews in the founding. Neither was thinking particularly clearly about the matter, because neither had truly found its balance after World War II. Both knew the Levant was important, but neither saw the Levant as a central battleground at that moment. Israel slipped through the cracks. 
Once the question of Jewish unity was settled through ruthless action by David Ben Gurion's government, Israel faced a simultaneous threat from all of its immediate neighbors. However, as we have seen, the threat in 1948 was more apparent than real. The northern Levant, Lebanon, was fundamentally disunited — far more interested in regional maritime trade and concerned about control from Damascus. It posed no real threat to Israel. Jordan, settling the eastern bank of the Jordan River, was an outside power that had been transplanted into the region and was more concerned about native Arabs — the Palestinians — than about Israel. The Jordanians secretly collaborated with Israel. Egypt did pose a threat, but its ability to maintain lines of supply across the Sinai was severely limited and its genuine interest in engaging and destroying Israel was more rhetorical than real. As usual, the Egyptians could not afford the level of effort needed to move into the Levant. Syria by itself had a very real interest in Israel's defeat, but by itself was incapable of decisive action. 
The exterior lines of Israel's neighbors prevented effective, concerted action. Israel's interior lines permitted efficient deployment and redeployment of force. It was not obvious at the time, but in retrospect we can see that once Israel existed, was united and had even limited military force, its survival was guaranteed. That is, so long as no great power was opposed to its existence. 
From its founding until the Camp David Accords re-established the Sinai as a buffer with Egypt, Israel's strategic problem was this: So long as Egypt was in the Sinai, Israel's national security requirements outstripped its military capabilities. It could not simultaneously field an army, maintain its civilian economy and produce all the weapons and supplies needed for war. Israel had to align itself with great powers who saw an opportunity to pursue other interests by arming Israel. 
Israel's first patron was the Soviet Union — through Czechoslovakia — which supplied weapons before and after 1948 in the hopes of using Israel to gain a foothold in the eastern Mediterranean. Israel, aware of the risks of losing autonomy, also moved into a relationship with a declining great power that was fighting to retain its empire: France. Struggling to hold onto Algeria and in constant tension with Arabs, France saw Israel as a natural ally. And apart from the operation against Suez in 1956, Israel saw in France a patron that was not in a position to reduce Israeli autonomy. However, with the end of the Algerian war and the realignment of France in the Arab world, Israel became a liability to France and, after 1967, Israel lost French patronage. 
Israel did not become a serious ally of the Americans until after 1967. Such an alliance was in the American interest. The United States had, as a strategic imperative, the goal of keeping the Soviet navy out of the Mediterranean or, at least, blocking its unfettered access. That meant that Turkey, controlling the Bosporus, had to be kept in the American bloc. Syria and Iraq shifted policies in the late 1950s and by the mid-1960s had been armed by the Soviets. This made Turkey's position precarious: If the Soviets pressed from the north while Syria and Iraq pressed from the south, the outcome would be uncertain, to say the least, and the global balance of power was at stake.
The United States used Iran to divert Iraq's attention. Israel was equally useful in diverting Syria's attention. So long as Israel threatened Syria from the south, it could not divert its forces to the north. That helped secure Turkey at a relatively low cost in aid and risk. By aligning itself with the interests of a great power, Israel lost some of its room for maneuver: For example, in 1973, it was limited by the United States in what it could do to Egypt. But those limitations aside, it remained autonomous internally and generally free to pursue its strategic interests. 
The end of hostilities with Egypt, guaranteed by the Sinai buffer zone, created a new era for Israel. Egypt was restored to its traditional position, Jordan was a marginal power on the east bank, Lebanon was in its normal, unstable mode, and only Syria was a threat. However, it was a threat that Israel could easily deal with. Syria by itself could not threaten the survival of Israel. 
Following Camp David (an ironic name), Israel was in its Davidic model, in a somewhat modified sense. Its survival was not at stake. Its problems — the domination of a large, hostile population and managing events in the northern Levant — were subcritical (meaning that, though these were not easy tasks, they did not represent fundamental threats to national survival, so long as Israel retained national unity). When unified, Israel has never been threatened by its neighbors. Geography dictates against it.
Israel's danger will come only if a great power seeks to dominate the Mediterranean Basin or to occupy the region between Afghanistan and the Mediterranean. In the short period since the fall of the Soviet Union, this has been impossible. There has been no great power with the appetite and the will for such an adventure. But 15 years is not even a generation, and Israel must measure its history in centuries. 
It is the nature of the international system to seek balance. The primary reality of the world today is the overwhelming power of the United States. The United States makes few demands on Israel that matter. However, it is the nature of things that the United States threatens the interests of other great powers who, individually weak, will try to form coalitions against it. Inevitably, such coalitions will arise. That will be the next point of danger for Israel. 
In the event of a global rivalry, the United States might place onerous requirements on Israel. Alternatively, great powers might move into the Jordan River valley or ally with Syria, move into Lebanon or ally with Israel. The historical attraction of the eastern shore of the Mediterranean would focus the attention of such a power and lead to attempts to assert control over the Mediterranean or create a secure Middle Eastern empire. In either event, or some of the others discussed, it would create a circumstance in which Israel might face a Babylonian catastrophe or be forced into some variation of a Persian or Roman subjugation. 
Israel's danger is not a Palestinian rising. Palestinian agitation is an irritant that Israel can manage so long as it does not undermine Israeli unity. Whether it is managed by domination or by granting the Palestinians a vassal state matters little. Nor can Israel be threatened by its neighbors. Even a unified attack by Syria and Egypt would fail, for the reasons discussed. Israel's real threat, as can be seen in history, lies in the event of internal division and/or a great power, coveting Israel's geographical position, marshalling force that is beyond its capacity to resist. Even that can be managed if Israel has a patron whose interests involve denying the coast to another power. 
Israel's reality is this. It is a small country, yet must manage threats arising far outside of its region. It can survive only if it maneuvers with great powers commanding enormously greater resources. Israel cannot match the resources and, therefore, it must be constantly clever. There are periods when it is relatively safe because of great power alignments, but its normal condition is one of global unease. No nation can be clever forever, and Israel's history shows that some form of subordination is inevitable. Indeed, it is to a very limited extent subordinate to the United States now. 
For Israel, the retention of a Davidic independence is difficult. Israel's strategy must be to manage its subordination effectively by dealing with its patron cleverly, as it did with Persia. But cleverness is not a geopolitical concept. It is not permanent, and it is not assured. And that is the perpetual crisis of Jerusalem.

The Washington Post   From a Saudi prince, tough talk on America’s favoritism toward Israel   Richard Cohen      June 13 -- As best I can recall, I first met Saudi Arabia’s Prince Turki al-Faisal at a private home in Washington years ago. I found him stern and humorless, sometimes even bitter. I have seen him since at international conferences and the like — never in the mood for small talk and exhibiting, sometimes in his glorious robes, not an ounce of Bedouin charm. Still, I was unprepared for the opinion column he published in Sunday’s Post. It read like a declaration of war.   Prince Turki is not now in the government. Yet he is a member of the Saudi royal family and was once the kingdom’s intelligence chief and its former ambassador to both London and Washington. The man is solidly credentialed.   He is also angry as hell, and he lets America have it. He starts by citing what he calls President Obama’s “controversial speech last month, admonishing Arab governments to embrace democracy and provide freedom to their populations.” Saudi Arabia, he wrote, heard what Obama said and took it “seriously,” and he noted, of course, that Obama had not demanded the same rights for Palestinians under Israeli occupation. Point taken.   But the same kingdom that has taken Obama “seriously” is an absolute monarchy that, among other things, bans women from driving cars. It is also a country that offers no freedom of religion but offers, for the occasional criminal, a public beheading. Given that Turki has spent a good deal of time in the West, it’s not possible that he was unaware that commentators like me would be picky about the lack of basic freedoms. He doesn’t care.   Indeed, that was the point. Turki — and by implication all of Saudi Arabia — has had it with the United States. The kingdom will not be lectured to. It is sick and tired of American favoritism to Israel — the exuberant congressional reception for Binyamin Netanyahu, for example — and the administration’s decision to oppose any effort in the United Nations to create a Palestinian state. In this matter, America is doing what Israel wants.    “In September, the kingdom will use its considerable diplomatic might to support the Palestinians in their quest for international recognition,” Turki wrote. “American leaders have long called Israel an ‘indispensable’ ally. They will soon learn that there are other players in the region — not least the Arab street — who are as, if not more, ‘indispensable.’ The game of favoritism toward Israel has not proven wise for Washington, and soon it will be shown to be an even greater folly.”   This is not your usual diplomatic language — and even for Turki it is rough. It shows, though, a not-surprising frustration in the Arab world with American policy tethered for the moment to a quite stubborn and unimaginative Israeli policy. Both countries are suffering from a surfeit of democracy. Israel’s governing coalition is held hostage by the right; America’s governing coalition is in the same fix.    Turki does not run out of wagging fingers. He says that those who think that the United States and Israel will determine the future of Palestine are dead wrong. “There will be disastrous consequences for U.S.-Saudi relations if the United States vetoes U.N. recognition of a Palestinian state. It would mark a nadir in the decades-long relationship as well as irrevocably damage the Israeli-Palestinian peace process and America’s reputation among Arab nations. The ideological distance between the Muslim world and the West in general would widen — and opportunities for friendship and cooperation between the two could vanish.” This from our ally, not to mention friendly gas station.   The tone of the column is both remarkable and ominous. It comes, as I said, from a man of little charm, but he is nevertheless a skilled diplomat and intelligence chief. While his vexation over the Palestinian problem is well-known, rarely has it been carried to this extent — and in such a public venue.   A Post opinion column is designed to get the attention of the American government. I’m sure Prince Turki succeeded in that. But I hope he also got the attention of the Israeli government, which for some time now has enjoyed Saudi moderation on the Palestinian question. That seems about to change — not the least because the Arab street that Turki expressly mentioned is demanding it and the Saudis will, if they have to, appease the street. This is the gravamen of Prince Turki’s piece and is why he ends it so ominously for Israel: “I’d hate to be around when they face their comeuppance.”          Article 2.   Boston Globe   Turkey’s new challenges   Stephen Kinzer       June 14, 2011 -- SUNDAY’S ELECTION in Turkey was another reminder of the country’s astonishing rise, which has been one of the most dramatic geopolitical stories of the last decade. For the first 80 years of its existence as a nation, Turkey was dominated by generals and played almost no role in the world. Now it is a vibrant democracy and a major force in the Middle East, the Caucasus, North Africa, the Balkans, and beyond. The election was a triumph for Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has presided over his country’s remarkable transformation. His party won more votes than all other parties combined, making him the first Turkish prime minister in more than half a century to win three consecutive terms. He will naturally be tempted to take this victory as a mandate to charge ahead with his own projects. Instead he should do the opposite: curb his divisive rhetoric, adjust his authoritarian style, and seek broad support for projects that will strengthen Turkey and help calm the world’s most volatile region.   Syrians who are racing toward Turkey in search of refuge represent Erdogan’s most immediate challenge. Turkey has become not just a safe haven, but a model for what many Arabs would like to see their countries become. This model — a government with roots in Islam but also committed to democracy, free enterprise, and good relations with Europe and the United States — represents the dream of millions of Tunisians, Libyans, Egyptians, Yemenis, Syrians, Jordanians, and Palestinians.   Finding a way to stabilize the ever-more-turbulent Middle East is Turkey’s most urgent task. Erdogan is obsessed with his drive to make Turkey one of the world’s 10 biggest economies (it is now 17th). This will only be possible if the Middle East is peaceful and open for business.   Besides dealing with upheaval in the Arab world, Turkey faces three other key foreign policy challenges. First is the continuing division of Cyprus between ethnic Greek and Turkish sectors. Second is the frozen conflict with Armenia, which seemed to be on the brink of resolution until Turkish and Armenian nationalists killed a promising agreement reached by both countries two years ago. Erdogan’s new mandate gives him the power to overrule militants in his ranks. If he does, and if Armenian leaders can do the same, the entire region will benefit.   Third is to rebuild relations with Israel. Erdogan has become a hero in the Middle East for his forthright denunciations of Israel’s occupation of the West Bank and its blockade of Gaza. Like many Turks, he is still enraged over the murder of nine Turkish civilians by Israeli commandos who stormed a freighter bearing relief supplies for Gaza last year. His anger may be justified by the facts, but he should realize that a resumption of Turkey’s good ties to Israel could be a decisive step toward Middle East peace.   Foreign policy challenges are only part of Erdogan’s post-election agenda. He also needs to deepen Turkish democracy. That would require resolving the decades-old Kurdish conflict and taking concrete steps to reassure secular Turks that their country is not moving toward religious rule.   Turkey’s grand project in the next couple of years will be writing a new constitution to replace the one imposed by generals three decades ago. Erdogan wants to replace the current parliamentary system with one built around a strong president and then run for the presidency himself. His party did not win enough seats in Parliament to impose a constitution on its own, so if he wants to make such a radical change, he will have to propose a constitution that represents a national consensus. That can only be reached if the constitution includes strong guarantees of free speech, rights for women, judicial independence, and cultural freedom for all ethnic and religious groups.   Such a constitution would embody the wishes of most Turks. It might also reinvigorate Turkey’s stalled campaign to join the European Union. If Turkey becomes an EU member by the time it celebrates its 100th anniversary in 2023, that would be Erdogan’s eternal legacy.   Turkey is poised to become one of the most successful countries of the 21st century, a model of Muslim democracy and a powerful force for regional peace. Whether it will fulfill its potential depends largely on how Erdogan handles the mandate he has just won.

The Financial Times    Why Syria will get away with it   Gideon Rachman      June 13 2011 --  late last week, Robert Gates, the US defence secretary, launched an offensive of his own. In a speech in Brussels, he dismissed most of America’s European allies as a useless bunch of timewasters. I paraphrase  but not much.    Mr Gates pointed out that while all Nato countries had voted to intervene in Libya, most had chosen not to participate in the actual fighting. Even those European countries that are taking part began to run short of munitions just 11 weeks into the fighting – forcing an exasperated America to step into the breach. More broadly, a situation in which the US accounts for 75 per cent of the military spending in Nato was “unacceptable” and unsustainable. If it is not rectified, Mr Gates predicted, Nato faces a “dismal” future.   The conjunction of the Gates speech and the Syrian civil war is very telling. It explains why a 20-year experiment with the idea that western military force can put the world to rights is coming to a close.    Just a few weeks ago, that would have seemed a surprising conclusion. Supporters of “liberal interventionism” hailed the decision to bomb Colonel Gaddafis forces in Libya as evidence of a longed-for new era, in which dictators can no longer feel free to massacre their own people.    However a western failure to intervene, as the Syrian army brutalises and kills its own citizens, is likely to be a more accurate guide to the future than the Libyan campaign. There is, of course, a direct link between the west’s reluctance to get involved in Syria and the frustrating and (so far) inconclusive nature of the Libyan intervention.    However, the Syrian conflict also needs to be seen in the context of a generation-long experiment with liberal interventionism. That era began in 1991, when the collapse of the Soviet Union left the US as the world’s sole superpower and a swift victory in the first Gulf war restored confidence in the power and effectiveness of American military might. Since then, the debate about how and when to use military power has waxed and waned. Western governments chastised themselves over the failure to protect the Kurds and the Shia in Iraq in 1991, over the Rwandan genocide of 1994 and over the many years of dithering as lives were lost in the Balkans. But a series of apparently successful interventions – Bosnia, Kosovo, East Timor, Sierra Leone – gradually strengthened the belief that western military power could be used to end conflicts and save civilians.   The bitter experiences of the Afghan and Iraq wars, however, shifted the debate on military intervention once more. Both Barack Obama in the US and David Cameron in Britain promised to be leaders who would adopt a much more cautious attitude to foreign military adventures. Then along came the Arab spring and western leaders once again found themselves committing to military action, this time in Libya – Mr Obama with evident reluctance, Mr Cameron and President Nicolas Sarkozy of France with apparent enthusiasm.   The Libyan war illustrates how unfolding events can force a political leader’s hand. That could still happen in Syria. But it seems much more likely that, this time, the west will stand aside.    In part, this is because of deadlock at the UN, where Russia and China  angry about the Libyan war  are blocking efforts to pass a resolution that even condemns events in Syria, let alone prepares the ground for intervention. However the broader context is the west’s diminishing ability and willingness to intervene at all.   The Gates speech effectively marks the end of the American ambition to turn Nato into the global, military arm of a unified western world. The Americans have flirted with this idea, ever since the onset of the “war on terror”. But, as the Afghan war has worn on, so the military effort has become more and more heavily dependent on the US.    The fact that Europeans called for a campaign in Libya that they are incapable of conducting alone has merely re-enforced the American view that the European arm of Nato is, to varying degrees, feckless and unreliable. Disarray and recriminations within Nato hobble the single most effective potential tool for western military intervention overseas.   Even more significant in the long run is the American anxiety that budgetary constraints, which are leading to defence cuts in Europe, are beginning to be replicated in the US itself. Admiral Michael Mullen, America’s top military officer, has called the budget deficit the single biggest threat to US national security. It is also the single biggest constraint on future bouts of “liberal interventionism”.   Money is not the only problem, however. Over the past 20 years it has become apparent that swiftly agreed-upon military actions can lead to entanglements that last for many years. There is still a Nato mission in Kosovo and an EU military mission in Bosnia, more than a decade after the fighting ended in both places.    As for Afghanistan – that conflict has now lasted almost twice as long as the second world war. Western governments are also only beginning to come to terms with what may soon be required in Libya. Against this background, there are very few takers for yet another military venture – this time in Syria.       Article 4.   The American Interest   The Conservative Revolutionary   Walter Russell Mead       June 12, 2011 -- The United States is the most revolutionary power in the history of the world, but after more than 200 years of a brilliant revolutionary career we are still not very good at understanding or responding to the revolutions our example, our ideas, our economy and our technology do so much to create.   The Arab spring is the latest example of the clash between America’s revolutionary world role and our pathetic cluelessness about the forces we do so much to promote.  The Arab Spring is turning into a long, hot summer.  Civil wars in Libya, Syria and Yemen and the sullen silence of the Shi’a in Bahrain have baptized Arab democracy in blood.  More will flow — and American foreign policy is befuddled and bemused.   None of the experts look particularly smart at the moment.  The ‘realists’ who counseled President Obama to forget George W. Bush’s support of Middle Eastern democracy and cultivate our relations with regional despots like Hosni Mubarak, the Iranian mullahs and the younger Assad have been sent back to the benches in disgrace.  Their counsel is now seen as both morally dubious and pragmatically unwise; the ‘realists’ would have put the US on the wrong side of history in the service of unrealistic assumptions about the stability of despotic regimes.   But the idealists who seek to replace them already have egg on their faces.  “Days, not weeks” is what they promised the President when he began to bomb for democracy in Libya.  The democratic revolution in Egypt is looking less democratic by the day; it looks more and more as if the Army used public unrest to block the Mubarak family’s attempt to turn Egypt into a family possession.  The Army has ruled Egypt since the overthrow of King Farouk, playing liberals and religious conservatives off against each other.  It looks set to go on doing that for some time to come.  In Yemen, Bahrain and Syria, the counsel of the idealists seems dark and confused.  US policy overall seems to have found the ‘sour spot’ that is the particular curse of the Obama administration: too friendly to the revolt to earn the trust and gratitude of the despots, too cautious and compromising to win many friends on the street.   Overall I am more cautious than optimistic about where the Arab Spring is headed.  There is little prospect for the kind of rapid economic growth that could improve the prospects for young unemployed and underemployed Arabs.  Foreign investment and tourism have already been badly hit by the unrest of the last six months, and the Arab regimes are turning to aid donors and organizations like the IMF and the World Bank in increasing desperation.   Culturally, many of the necessary preconditions are not in place.  The poor quality of most Arab universities, the limited access to serious political history and discourse among all but a handful of Arab intellectuals, the suppression of political life under past dictatorships, the weakness of Islamic political thought in recent centuries and the absence of a robust and deeply rooted tradition of Islamic democracy all work against the rapid widespread development of stable liberal democracy in the Arab world.   Putting the dark economic outlook together with the problematic cultural and political situation makes optimism a tough position to hold.  Without in any way scanting or minimizing the idealism, dedication and vision of the democrats rising in the Arab world today, they still seem a long way from winning.  They remind me still of the Marquis de Lafayette during the French Revolution: they believe in all the right ideas, but their countries aren’t ready for the vision they seek to promote.  They can help make a revolution but others will, for a time at least, determine the flow of events.   If true, then both the realists and the idealists are wrong about the Arab Revolution.  The realists are wrong that despotic regimes can provide long term stability in the region; the idealists are wrong that the fall of the old despots will lead to liberal democratic states.   Americans have been getting foreign revolutions wrong for more than 200 years.  It began with the French Revolution.  Enthusiasts like Thomas Jefferson initially thought they saw France following in America’s footsteps.  Then came the Reign of Terror, Napoleon, and a generation of brutal war.   Many Americans responded with the same generous enthusiasm to the South American revolutions against colonial rule.  Once again, those revolutions failed to establish anything like liberal democratic rule.   The cycles of revolution — 1830, 1848, 1917-20, 1946-1960 (decolonization), 1989-91, 2003-5 and now 2011 — catch Americans flatfooted over and over again.  We are surprised when they occur, and we are surprised when they fail to follow the course we expect.   Delusional Realists   The realists are half right: most revolutions will not bring about stable democratic societies.  But realists get the other half wrong; revolution is a basic fact of modern life and the kind of ‘stability’ that old fashioned diplomats long for is just a mirage.  American foreign policy cannot proceed on the assumption that despotic, frozen regimes will last.  They won’t.  Sooner or later they will come crashing down — and as the pace of technological and social change around the world continues to accelerate, such revolutionary upheavals are likely to become more frequent.   There is another problem with realism.  Like it or not, the United States is a revolutionary power.  Whether our government is trying to overthrow foreign dictators is almost irrelevant; American society is the most revolutionary force on the planet.  The Internet is more subversive than the CIA in its prime.  The dynamism of American society is constantly creating new businesses, new technologies, new ideas and new social models.  These innovations travel, and they make trouble when they do.  Saudi conservatives know that whatever geopolitical arrangements the Saudi princes make with the American government, the American people are busily undermining the core principles of Saudi society.  It’s not just our NGOs educating Saudi women and civil society activists; it’s not just the impact of American college life on the rising generation of the Saudi elite.  We change the world even when we aren’t thinking anything about global revolution — when Hollywood and rap musicians are just trying to make a buck, they are stoking the fires of change around the world.   A revolutionary nation cannot make a conservative foreign policy work for long.  In the 1820s and 1830s Washington tried to reassure the Mexican government that it had no hostile designs against Mexican territory.  But the American people were moving into Texas and the US government couldn’t stop that movement or blunt the threat to Mexico if it tried.  In the same way today, the economic and political activity of individual Americans and American companies is changing the world in ways that make life much harder for governments in countries like Russia, China and Saudi Arabia.  We can press all the reset buttons with Russia that we want, but the Russian government will still notice that both US society and sometimes the government are actively working to help foreign subversives overthrow repressive regimes.   Feckless Idealists   If the desire of our realists to conduct foreign policy with foreign despots as if unprincipled cooperation with the bad guys could build a stable world is unrealistic, the idealism of our enthusiasts that every new foreign revolution will bring a millennium of democratic peace is absurd.   American foreign policy cannot expect that revolutions in foreign countries will rescue us from the painful dilemmas our foreign policy often confronts. Revolution is not the deus ex machina that will make the world peaceful; it is a tsunami that sweeps everything before it, and often leaves the world messier and more dangerous.   Modern history teaches two great lessons about revolution: that revolutions are inevitable, and that a large majority of revolutions either fail or go bad.  Americans almost instinctively look at revolutions in terms of our own past: the 1688 Glorious Revolution that made Parliament more powerful than the King in  England, and the American Revolution that led in relatively short order to the establishment of a stable and constitutional government.   Most revolutions don’t work like this at all.  Many of them fail, with the old despots crushing dissent or making only cosmetic changes to the old system.  (This happened in Austria in 1848 and something very like it may be happening in Egypt today.)  Others move into radicalism, terror and mob rule before a new despot comes along to bring order — at least until the next futile and bloody revolutionary spasm.  That was France’s history for almost 100 years after the storming of the Bastille.  China, Russia and Iran all saw revolutions like this in the 20th century.   The revolutions that ‘work’ are the exceptions, not the rule.  The peaceful revolutions in the Central European countries as Soviet power melted in 1989-1990 are a unique exception to the rule that most revolutions either turn nasty or fail.  When many American idealists think about revolution today, they have Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary in mind.   Few assumptions can lead you into as much trouble this quickly.  Even in 1989-90, those countries were the exception and not the rule.  Think Ukraine, Belarus, Yugoslavia, Romania, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and of course Russia itself.  More people live in countries where the 1989-90 revolutionary wave failed to establish secure constitutional democracy than live in those where it succeeded.   More, the countries that had ‘velvet’ revolutions shared a number of important characteristics.  They had or longed to have close political and cultural ties to the West.  They wanted to join NATO and the EU, and had a reasonable confidence of doing so sooner rather than later.  They could expect enormous amounts of aid and foreign direct investment if they continued along the path of democratic reform.  They lay on the ‘western’ side of the ancient division of Europe between the Orthodox east and the Catholic/Protestant homeland of the modern liberal tradition.   No Arab country looks anything like this.  Indeed, most seem closer to Yugoslavia and Belarus or, at best, Ukraine.  We, and they, may get lucky, and the revolutions in the Arab world may lead to something that looks more like Central Europe than like Central Asia.  That would be a nice surprise, but we should not be placing large bets that this will actually happen.   China, by the way, does not look very much like the Czech Republic.  Revolution there is very unlikely to produce a US or European style democracy anytime soon.   If realists ignore the inevitability of revolution, idealists close their eyes to the problems of revolutionary upheavals in societies that have difficult histories, deep social divisions, and poor short term economic prospects.  Unfortunately the countries most likely to experience revolutions are usually the countries that lack the preconditions for Anglo-American style relatively peaceful revolutions that end with the establishment of stable constitutional order.  If things were going well in those countries, they would not be having revolutions.   Historically, revolutions in foreign countries are both necessary for their political development and inevitable.  They often tend to make American foreign policy more difficult — and the world more dangerous.  On the evidence so far, this is the pattern we are seeing in the Middle East today.   Revolutionary Realism?   The difficulty American policymakers have in coming to grips with the recurring phenomenon of foreign revolutions is rooted in America’s paradoxical world role.  We are not just the world’s leading revolutionary nation; we are also the chief custodian of the international status quo.  We are upholding the existing balance of power and the international system of finance and trade with one hand, but the American agenda in the world ultimately aims to transform rather than to defend.   It is harder to be an effective revolutionary power than to be a conservative one — and it is harder still to combine the two roles.   A traditional conservative power knows what it wants.  Revolutionary powers have a tougher job; building the future is harder work than holding on to the past.  This is particularly true in the American case; the global transformation we seek is unparalleled for depth, complexity and scale.   We are not sure how this revolutionary transformation works.  We know that it involves liberal political change: governments of law rather than of men and legitimacy derived from the consent of the governed as measured in regular and free elections.  We also know that involves intellectual and social change: traditional religious ideas must make room for the equality of the sexes and the rights of religious minorities.  Property rights must be rooted in law and protected by an independent judicial system.  While governments have a role in the economy, the mechanisms of the market must ultimately be allowed to work their way.   We do not agree among ourselves about the proper sequence of these changes.  We know that in the short run, democratic voting procedures may not produce liberal governments.  We know that demagogues and aspiring despots can use the language and even the mechanisms of democracy to build personal dictatorships (Napoleon III and Hugo Chavez, for example).  We know that popular opinion is sometimes more nationalistic than elite opinion and that gains for democracy do not always lead to more foreign policy cooperation.  In most cases, progress toward stable and peaceful democratic government comes slowly if it comes at all; even if you believe in ‘democratic peace theory, hoping that the democratization of other countries will solve American foreign policy problems is a fool’s game.   Yet we also know — or at least we believe — that in the long run a more democratic world is a better if not always a safer world, and that it would be immoral as well as impractical to stand in the way of the changes that need to come.   If we add the conservative mission of the United States to the revolutionary agenda, the problems of American foreign policy become more complex still.  We are trying to carry out a vast reordering of global society even as we preserve the stability of the international political order: we are trying to walk blindfolded on a tightrope across Niagara Falls — while changing our clothes.   The uncertainties and risks that surround us should not be underestimated.  There has never been a worldwide revolution of this kind before; nobody knows for sure how best to speed the plow.  Nobody has ever had to balance transformational and conservative roles on a global scale before.   From an American point of view, the Arab Spring is just another complication of this global task — a sudden thunderstorm with flashes of lightening, driving rain and unpredictable gusts of wind as we hop one-legged on the tightrope changing our pants.  The Islamic world is entering new territory as it struggles to integrate religious and liberal political values; as the United States tries to juggle its geopolitical interests with its values at a volatile moment in world history, we are almost certain to get the balance wrong much of the time.   Here, however, history offers some hope.  As I wrote at the beginning of this post, the United States has been doing two things for more than 200 years: getting foreign revolutions wrong, but somehow still pushing its global revolution forward.  America’s success as a conservative revolutionary power on a global scale depends less on the clever policies of our presidents and our secretaries of state, and more on the creativity and dynamism of American society as a whole.   It is power of a free people more than the brilliance of our intellectual and social establishment that has brought the United States this far; in that truth lies the secret of our revolution and of our success.               Article 5.   NYT   Iran Without Nukes   Roger Cohen      June 13, 2011 — Remember Iran?    I do. It’s been two years since the Iranian people rose up to protest a stolen election with a bravery that stirred the world and presented Americans with a truer image of a young and highly educated nation than the old specter of the bearded Islamic zealot. The Green Movement was suppressed through barbaric violence but its example helped kindle the Arab Spring.    As Hamid Dabashi of Columbia University wrote in July, 2009: “Tehran, I believe, is ground zero of a civil rights movement that will leave no Muslim or Arab country, or even Israel, untouched.” He added, “The moving pictures of Iranians flooding colorfully into the streets have forever altered the visual vocabulary of the global perception of ‘the Middle East.”’    Seldom were there more prescient words.    They were quoted by Nader Hashemi of the University of Denver in a recent talk on Iran, in which he noted shared Iranian and Arab aims: “Democracy and dignity, the rule of law and respect for basic human rights, political transparency and an end to corruption.”    That urge is still powerful in Iran beneath the opaque, directionless apparatus of the Islamic Republic. Iran is weak now, its ideology as tired as Osama Bin Laden’s, as marginal to peoples questing to reconcile their Muslim faith and modernity in new ways.    I would probe this weakness through new approaches. But we are stuck still with the world’s most paranoid relationship: the American-Iranian relationship. That’s largely because there’s another way to remember Iran — as the Godot of nuclear threats, the country always on the verge of producing a nuclear weapon or acquiring the “breakout capacity” to make one, but never, despite the dire warning of Israeli leaders dating back to the 1990s, doing either, preferring to dwell in the Islamic Republic’s favored zones: ambivalence and inertia. As one awaits this tortuous Godot, one might recall a forecast of a bomb by 1999 (Shimon Peres) or 2004 (Ehud Barak), or Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s talk of “a messianic apocalyptic cult controlling atomic bombs,” or my friend Jeffrey Goldberg’s allusion in The Atlantic last year to a “consensus” that there is “a better than 50 percent chance that Israel will launch a strike by next July.” That would be next month.    It might also be worth recalling that Meir Dagan, the former head of Israel’s Mossad spy agency, declared last month that attacking Iran would be “a stupid idea.” He suggested his main worry was not Iran itself but Netanyahu’s susceptibility to “dangerous adventure.”    Dagan’s concerns have surfaced as Seymour Hersh concludes in a New Yorker article this month that, as he put it in one interview, “There’s just no serious evidence inside that Iran is actually doing anything to make a nuclear weapon.”    His reporting reveals that the U.S. National Intelligence Estimate (N.I.E.) of 2007 — which concluded “with high confidence” that Iran had halted a nuclear-weapons program in 2003 — still pertains in the classified N.I.E. of 2011. As a retired senior intelligence official put it to Hersh, there’s nothing “substantially new” that “leads to a bomb.”    In other words, Iran, epicenter of inefficiency, unable to produce a kilowatt of electricity through its Bushehr nuclear reactor despite decades of effort, is still doing its old brinkmanship number.    Remember, Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader, is the guardian of the revolution. That is a conservative business. Breakout, let alone a bomb, is a bridge too far if the Islamic Republic is what you’ve vowed to preserve. Much better to gain leverage by producing low-enriched uranium — far from weapons grade — under International Atomic Energy Agency inspection and allow rumors to swirl.    So Iran, long at the top of the Washington agenda, has slid down. It’s partly the Arab Spring. It’s partly that you can’t keep saying the same thing. People do begin to remember the refrain, although nobody in the large Iran-the-clear-and-present-danger school ever seems to get called to account. They should be. The nuclear bogeyman obsession has been a distraction from the need to try to tease out a relationship with Tehran, see Iran as it is. Only the most flimsy efforts have been made, insufficient to test the waters.    Those waters are troubled. The Islamic Republic has not recovered from its convulsion of 2009. It is sickly, consumed by hypocrisy as it cheers on some brave Arabs (but not those in Syria) while brutalizing its own seekers of the freedom promised in 1979. Arabs aren’t buying Iranian hypocrisy. Only Iran’s command of Revolutionary Guard force and the opposition’s lack of a shared goal salvage it.    Khamenei is at loggerheads with President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who got into such a sulk recently that he took 11 days off work, infuriating everybody. The Majlis, or parliament, is investigating Ahmadinejad for various alleged frauds including, of all things, vote-buying in 2009! Ahmadinejad was booed during his June 3 speech commemorating Ayatollah Khomeini’s death. Iran is characterized by what Farideh Farhi of the University of Hawaii recently termed “administrative chaos.”    That’s not how you make a nuke. When remembering Iran — and it must be remembered — call the fear-mongers to account.                  Article 6.   NATIONAL REVIEW   Interview with - Francis Fukuyama:  The Difficulty of Political Order   Matthew Shaffer            MATTHEW SHAFFER: Origins is a historical work, as opposed to previous works, such as The End of History, and Our Posthuman Future, which were more theoretical. What, for you, is the prescriptive value of history?    FRANCIS FUKUYAMA: This really started with a practical concern I had after dealing with failed states and nation-building issues in the wake of September 11 and our nation-building efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq. It seemed to me that the United States in particular didn’t appreciate the difficulty of this kind of activity, because we didn’t adequately understand how hard it was to establish institutions. When I was at Johns Hopkins at SAIS [School of Advanced International Studies] I ran an international-development program, focusing on issues of anti-corruption and improving governance. And a lot of it seemed premised on an overly optimistic faith in the ability of outsiders to effect desired outcomes. So I decided to write a book about where institutions came from in countries that had them and could take them for granted. We’ve forgotten a lot of that history and how we’ve gotten to the present. Along the way it was also a means of revisiting a lot of The End of History 20 years later.       SHAFFER: Some theorists, like Hegel, think that history doesn’t just tell us what is stable, or what works, but actually points us toward moral progress. Do you believe that?     FUKUYAMA: Fundamentally, I believe in liberal democracy, that it’s the best form of government, and that the world has made moral progress. But that’s a separate question from whether the development of democratic institutions is inevitable and driven by an underlying historical force. I’ve become more skeptical of that latter belief over the years as I’ve become more attentive to the role of accident and contingency. And my current book is about a lot of that. For example: The reason we got to democracy in Europe is the almost accidental survival of a feudal institution — the English parliament — into the modern period. That’s something that didn’t happen in other European countries, and which we therefore can’t take for granted. So, as you see, the normative concern is separate from the empirical question of whether democracy is inevitable.       SHAFFER: Origins incorporates economics, anthropology, philosophy, and social psychology, for lessons about political order. Is that kind of study too rare today?     FUKUYAMA: This is partly the fault of the structure of academia. There’s such a premium placed on specialization and narrowness that it’s very hard to think more broadly and to cross disciplinary boundaries. I work at Stanford in an interdisciplinary institute, and I’ve been associated with these kinds of outfits for most of my years. And those are where the most interesting research gets done.       SHAFFER: What field outside of political science has the most important insights for understanding political order?     FUKUYAMA: That’s hard to say. I don’t know if there is one. Part of the problem is economics — it’s a very important discipline, but in a way it’s colonized the rest of the social sciences. A lot of political analysis in academia is driven by this model of everybody being a rational decision maker driven by more or less material interests. There’s obviously something to that, but it’s a very limited way of looking about politics, which is about dignity and values and ideas that can’t be explained in material terms. Other disciplines — sociology and anthropology — have gotten at those things better than economics has.       SHAFFER: Your chapter “How Christianity Undermines the Family” is provocatively titled and sort of microcosmic for your whole thesis. Can you tell us about it?     FUKUYAMA: You can’t have modern politics if society is based on the biological principles of supporting friends and family. That’s the natural mode of human sociability. We’re naturally inclined to take care of family and exchange favors with friends. Human beings will interact in that manner without anyone telling them to behave that way because it’s biologically grounded.     In all human societies, social order at one stage depended on extended kinship — people living in tribes where people traced ancestry to a common ancestor that may be three, four, or five generations dead. This was no less true of Europeans than it was of the Chinese, or Arabs, or Africans, or anyone else in the world. All the Germanic barbarians organized themselves tribally after overrunning the Roman Empire.  One of the broad questions I’ve addressed in the book is how did these different societies make an exit out of kinship-based social organization into a modern-based state, with impersonal, centralized administration? Europe in that respect was quite exceptional, because that happened early, and it happened through the agency of the Catholic Church, which changed the rules of inheritance for kin-groups. It forbade divorce, it forbade concubinage, and it forbade cousin marriages within three or four degrees of relatedness. All of these were practices in tribal societies that kept property within an extended kin-group. In the Arab world in many places they still encourage cross-cousin marriage, where you marry your first cousin and the two families get to keep property within this narrow circle.     When the Catholic Church [forbade cousin marriage] in the eighth century, it wasn’t thinking about the effect on kinship. It was acting in a self-interested way, because by cutting off these ways of kin-groups’ keeping property, the Church ended up being the beneficiary. So if a woman didn’t marry and didn’t have children but had a big estate, she tended to donate it to the Church. So the Church helped effect in Europe the breakdown of extended kinship very, very early. Even in the beginning of the Middle Ages, people owned property as individuals. Women could hold property — they could sell it, alienate it, in ways that they still can’t in parts of the Arab world. And this meant that individualism became very deeply rooted in European society. So some individualism was already established by the time Europe got to feudalism. And feudalism is basically a contract — it’s one that is very hierarchical, between a stronger and weaker person, but it is a contract between two people.     So the idea of exchange and private property dates way, way back, hundreds of years before the Enlightenment, Reformation, etc. So I think that the basis for European modernization traces all the way back to developments like that. In China, in India, the exit out of kinship was accomplished through political power, via a state that tried to create impersonal government layered on top of a kin-based society. And those kin-groups really never went away. Even in contemporary China and India, in certain parts there are still kin-groups that influence politics.       SHAFFER: But China had an impersonal government — a meritocratic bureaucracy — without Christianity, and long before the West did, yes?     FUKUYAMA: So you have to understand what that means. China didn’t create the first state, it created the first modern state, meaning a state which recruited people into a centralized bureaucracy based on talent and merit, essentially, and not based on family relations, or connections to the household of the emperor, or something of that sort. So it had a modern form of public administration. And this was all consolidated by the third century B.C. But what the country never got to was the rule of law. Up to the modern day, the concept of a sovereign being limited by the rule of law never existed. So what that meant is that at a very early period in their history, the Chinese perfected strong, absolutist government. And that’s been a consistent pattern — high-quality, authoritarian government. And I think that continues up to the present.       SHAFFER: Could we trace Western ascendance to that one factor, the rule of law?     FUKUYAMA: That’s what’s interesting about the present period. A lot of economic theory says you can’t have modern economic growth without Western-style rule of law. Economists who believe this are thinking about two critical things — property rights and contract enforcement. And there’s a lot of theory and a lot of empirical evidence that show that these are in fact important. The problem with that theory is that it doesn’t really square with the facts in contemporary China. As everybody knows, for the past three decades, China has been growing at double-digit rates and they don’t have Western rule of law.     I think you can rescue the theory in the long run, because without rule of law they can’t keep this up. In a way the challenge that contemporary China poses it that they are doing well, and in the short run they’re doing better than the United States without having these Western institutions. The real challenge is the long-run sustainability of that system, or of the two systems. And looking at that in the long-run, I would still bet on the West, with its rule of law and systems of checks and balances on authority.     SHAFFER: You’ve probably heard a lot of phony rebuttals based on misreading of The End of History. So, I won’t attempt one — but you’ve made oblique references to your own revisions and criticisms. How does the rise of China and the current Arab unrest, for example, fit into the end of history?     FUKUYAMA: If you understand the original thesis correctly, what I was saying is that there was a theory of history among progressive intellectuals for most of the 20th century. That theory of history was Marxism. And according to the Marxists, the end of history was a communist utopia. My observation in the late 1980s is that we weren’t going to get there. Liberal democracies seemed to be the highest stage of political development, and I didn’t see any real alternatives. If you understand the thesis that way, I still believe that. Nothing that’s happened in the last 20 years has convinced me that there’s a higher form of government. Certainly not 9/11 — I don’t think anybody wants to live in a place like Iran and Afghanistan, so I don’t think that’s a serious competitor. China is a more plausible alternative. But I don’t think that anybody who’s not culturally Chinese would duplicate their system, and the Chinese are not really proselytizing their system. So I still think liberal democracy is the default form of government.     What’s changed for me are a couple of things: One is the idea of political decay. It wasn’t an important part of the End of History. But I do think that all political systems, including liberal democracies, can decay over time. They can get too rigid, they can fail to adapt, and if they do, then they’re going to get into trouble, just like authoritarian systems. The other issue, which we’ve already touched on, is contingency in history. So the route to getting into modernity is, I now think, full of a lot of accident, and so it’s not as if there’s this inevitable historical process that driving us toward the present. I think it should make us both more appreciative of the fact that we’ve gotten to the present and also more aware of the fragility of modern institutions.       SHAFFER: A lot of people have related that — your focus on the contingency of political order, and our ability to construct democracies — to your “falling-out” with neoconservatism. Was that “falling out” just local to some of the failures and disappointments of the Bush years or was it a break with the intellectual project as a whole?     FUKUYAMA: It was more a practical dispute over methods. I didn’t think U.S. hard power was an effective method [for advancing liberal democracy], and the Bush administration hadn’t really thought through the implications of invading Iraq. I still think there are ways that the United States can help promote democracy, but it’s a slow and long-term process. For example, I’m on the board of the National Endowment for Democracy, which had an important role in supporting solidarity in Poland in the 1980s, and in Serbia, and the Orange Coalition in Ukraine. So there are ways in which we’ve encouraged democratic forces around the world. I still believe in that mission and project. But I don’t think the Bush administration actually invaded Iraq to promote democracy. They had security objectives in mind, and they added the democracy argument as an afterthought, and that’s what stuck in people’s minds. That was a mistake, because it kind of undermined the notion of democracy promotion, simply because it was connected to a very unpopular intervention.     SHAFFER: Taking lessons from that, what can we do to promote democracy in the aftermath of the “Arab Spring”?     FUKUYAMA: We already are doing a lot. We’ve got organizations like the National Democratic Institute, or the International Republican Institute, that are all over Tunisia and Egypt and Libya, and other places, trying to help them organize political parties, trade unions, civil-society organizations, that hopefully will allow the more Western-oriented democrats in those Arab countries to actually contest in the elections. As we move toward votes in Tunisia and Egypt we want to have some alternative to the Muslim Brotherhood and the military. So we’re giving them that kind of assistance right now. That’s difficult, because they haven’t had experience with democracy previously.     It’s a long-term struggle, and I think we’ll be disappointed in the short run. I don’t think the more pro-Western forces are the ones that will end up on top in the short-run. But we’ve got to start somewhere.     SHAFFER: Is the spread of liberal democracy dependent upon persisting American hegemony?     FUKUYAMA: It’s been helpful. The U.S. obviously plays a big role in maintaining a liberal, open world order, through its alliances and the influence it projects. And American ideas have been very dominant in the world especially in the last two decades. A lot of that is shifting now because of the rise of other powers and other ideas. But the idea of liberal democracy — the U.S. is not the only exemplar of liberal democracy — [remains]. It’s a powerful idea that would exist independently of whether the U.S. is hegemonic or not.     I’m not as scared of a world without American hegemony as some people are. We went through the whole Cold War period in which the U.S. was one of two superpowers. A return to a more multi-polar world in certain ways induces a fair amount of moderation among big players in the system, because people know they can’t get their way unilaterally. And in the more multi-polar world we’d probably think twice about doing things like Iraq. The more important question is: In the global marketplace of ideas, how dominant will American ideas about freedom and rule of law and democracy and our economic model be? Our ideas will obviously be challenged; and it’s important for the U.S. to put its own house in order, both politically and economically, because that’s the most important way we exercise influence around the world: The model we set.       SHAFFER: To revisit Our Posthuman Future, are there any developments in bio-technologies in the past nine years that you find particularly disturbing?     FUKUYAMA: Yes. The whole rise of synthetic biology, where we’ve had new forms of life, and the ability to do new forms of life is proceeding extremely rapidly. The creation of an artificial bacteria itself is not immediately threatening, but it’s part of a long-term process by which we’ll uncover the technologies for manufacturing life, in ways that could have very serious security and moral implications.       SHAFFER: Don’t bioethics pose a challenge to the idea that the best society is the most successful society? You argue in Our Posthuman Future that a society that genetically engineered its children to be more intelligent might be more productive and successful but wouldn’t be moral.     FUKUYAMA: I’ve got a simpler concern in my current book. It’s just that liberal democracy is not something you can take for granted, or that democracies will find a way to solve their problems. I think we’ve got a number of long-term problems in the United States that don’t seem to be getting addressed with the current political system.    Matthew Shaffer is a William F. Buckley Fellow at the National Review Institute        Article 7.   Project Syndicate   Does Anything Matter?   Peter Singer      2011-06-13 – Can moral judgments be true or false? Or is ethics, at bottom, a purely subjective matter, for individuals to choose, or perhaps relative to the culture of the society in which one lives? We might have just found out the answer.   Among philosophers, the view that moral judgments state objective truths has been out of fashion since the 1930’s, when logical positivists asserted that, because there seems to be no way of verifying the truth of moral judgments, they cannot be anything other than expressions of our feelings or attitudes. So, for example, when we say, “You ought not to hit that child,” all we are really doing is expressing our disapproval of your hitting the child, or encouraging you to stop hitting the child. There is no truth to the matter of whether or not it is wrong for you to hit the child.   Although this view of ethics has often been challenged, many of the objections have come from religious thinkers who appealed to God’s commands. Such arguments have limited appeal in the largely secular world of Western philosophy. Other defenses of objective truth in ethics made no appeal to religion, but could make little headway against the prevailing philosophical mood.   Last month, however, saw a major philosophical event: the publication of Derek Parfit’s long-awaited book On What Matters. Until now, Parfit, who is Emeritus Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, had written only one book, Reasons and Persons, which appeared in 1984, to great acclaim. Parfit’s entirely secular arguments, and the comprehensive way in which he tackles alternative positions, have, for the first time in decades, put those who reject objectivism in ethics on the defensive.   On What Matters is a book of daunting length: two large volumes, totaling more than 1,400 pages, of densely argued text. But the core of the argument comes in the first 400 pages, which is not an insurmountable challenge for the intellectually curious – particularly given that Parfit, in the best tradition of English-language philosophy, always strives for lucidity, never using obscure words where simple ones will do. Each sentence is straightforward, the argument is clear, and Parfit often uses vivid examples to make his points. Thus, the book is an intellectual treat for anyone who wants to understand not so much “what matters” as whether anything really can matter, in an objective sense.   Many people assume that rationality is always instrumental: reason can tell us only how to get what we want, but our basic wants and desires are beyond the scope of reasoning. Not so, Parfit argues. Just as we can grasp the truth that 1 + 1 = 2, so we can see that I have a reason to avoid suffering agony at some future time, regardless of whether I now care about, or have desires about, whether I will suffer agony at that time. We can also have reasons (though not always conclusive reasons) to prevent others from suffering agony. Such self-evident normative truths provide the basis for Parfit’s defense of objectivity in ethics.   One major argument against objectivism in ethics is that people disagree deeply about right and wrong, and this disagreement extends to philosophers who cannot be accused of being ignorant or confused. If great thinkers like Immanuel Kant and Jeremy Bentham disagree about what we ought to do, can there really be an objectively true answer to that question?   Parfit’s response to this line of argument leads him to make a claim that is perhaps even bolder than his defense of objectivism in ethics. He considers three leading theories about what we ought to do – one deriving from Kant, one from the social-contract tradition of Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, and the contemporary philosophers John Rawls and T.M. Scanlon, and one from Bentham’s utilitarianism – and argues that the Kantian and social-contract theories must be revised in order to be defensible.   Then he argues that these revised theories coincide with a particular form of consequentialism, which is a theory in the same broad family as utilitarianism. If Parfit is right, there is much less disagreement between apparently conflicting moral theories than we all thought. The defenders of each of these theories are, in Parfit’s vivid phrase, “climbing the same mountain on different sides.”   Readers who go to On What Matters seeking an answer to the question posed by its title might be disappointed. Parfit’s real interest is in combating subjectivism and nihilism. Unless he can show that objectivism is true, he believes, nothing matters.   When Parfit does come to the question of “what matters,” his answer might seem surprisingly obvious. He tells us, for example, that what matters most now is that “we rich people give up some of our luxuries, ceasing to overheat the Earth’s atmosphere, and taking care of this planet in other ways, so that it continues to support intelligent life.”   Many of us had already reached that conclusion. What we gain from Parfit’s work is the possibility of defending these and other moral claims as objective truths.

From a Saudi prince, tough talk on America’s favoritism toward Israel


Richard Cohen





June 13 -- As best I can recall, I first met Saudi Arabia’s Prince Turki al-Faisal at a private home in Washington years ago. I found him stern and humorless, sometimes even bitter. I have seen him since at international conferences and the like — never in the mood for small talk and exhibiting, sometimes in his glorious robes, not an ounce of Bedouin charm. Still, I was unprepared for the opinion column he published in Sunday’s Post. It read like a declaration of war.


Prince Turki is not now in the government. Yet he is a member of the Saudi royal family and was once the kingdom’s intelligence chief and its former ambassador to both London and Washington. The man is solidly credentialed.


He is also angry as hell, and he lets America have it. He starts by citing what he calls President Obama’s “controversial speech last month, admonishing Arab governments to embrace democracy and provide freedom to their populations.” Saudi Arabia, he wrote, heard what Obama said and took it “seriously,” and he noted, of course, that Obama had not demanded the same rights for Palestinians under Israeli occupation. Point taken.


But the same kingdom that has taken Obama “seriously” is an absolute monarchy that, among other things, bans women from driving cars. It is also a country that offers no freedom of religion but offers, for the occasional criminal, a public beheading. Given that Turki has spent a good deal of time in the West, it’s not possible that he was unaware that commentators like me would be picky about the lack of basic freedoms. He doesn’t care.


Indeed, that was the point. Turki — and by implication all of Saudi Arabia — has had it with the United States. The kingdom will not be lectured to. It is sick and tired of American favoritism to Israel — the exuberant congressional reception for Binyamin Netanyahu, for example — and the administration’s decision to oppose any effort in the United Nations to create a Palestinian state. In this matter, America is doing what Israel wants. 


“In September, the kingdom will use its considerable diplomatic might to support the Palestinians in their quest for international recognition,” Turki wrote. “American leaders have long called Israel an ‘indispensable’ ally. They will soon learn that there are other players in the region — not least the Arab street — who are as, if not more, ‘indispensable.’ The game of favoritism toward Israel has not proven wise for Washington, and soon it will be shown to be an even greater folly.”


This is not your usual diplomatic language — and even for Turki it is rough. It shows, though, a not-surprising frustration in the Arab world with American policy tethered for the moment to a quite stubborn and unimaginative Israeli policy. Both countries are suffering from a surfeit of democracy. Israel’s governing coalition is held hostage by the right; America’s governing coalition is in the same fix. 


Turki does not run out of wagging fingers. He says that those who think that the United States and Israel will determine the future of Palestine are dead wrong. “There will be disastrous consequences for U.S.-Saudi relations if the United States vetoes U.N. recognition of a Palestinian state. It would mark a nadir in the decades-long relationship as well as irrevocably damage the Israeli-Palestinian peace process and America’s reputation among Arab nations. The ideological distance between the Muslim world and the West in general would widen — and opportunities for friendship and cooperation between the two could vanish.” This from our ally, not to mention friendly gas station.


The tone of the column is both remarkable and ominous. It comes, as I said, from a man of little charm, but he is nevertheless a skilled diplomat and intelligence chief. While his vexation over the Palestinian problem is well-known, rarely has it been carried to this extent — and in such a public venue.


A Post opinion column is designed to get the attention of the American government. I’m sure Prince Turki succeeded in that. But I hope he also got the attention of the Israeli government, which for some time now has enjoyed Saudi moderation on the Palestinian question. That seems about to change — not the least because the Arab street that Turki expressly mentioned is demanding it and the Saudis will, if they have to, appease the street. This is the gravamen of Prince Turki’s piece and is why he ends it so ominously for Israel: “I’d hate to be around when they face their comeuppance.”

Turkey’s new challenges


Stephen Kinzer 





June 14, 2011 -- SUNDAY’S ELECTION in Turkey was another reminder of the country’s astonishing rise, which has been one of the most dramatic geopolitical stories of the last decade. For the first 80 years of its existence as a nation, Turkey was dominated by generals and played almost no role in the world. Now it is a vibrant democracy and a major force in the Middle East, the Caucasus, North Africa, the Balkans, and beyond. The election was a triumph for Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has presided over his country’s remarkable transformation. His party won more votes than all other parties combined, making him the first Turkish prime minister in more than half a century to win three consecutive terms. He will naturally be tempted to take this victory as a mandate to charge ahead with his own projects. Instead he should do the opposite: curb his divisive rhetoric, adjust his authoritarian style, and seek broad support for projects that will strengthen Turkey and help calm the world’s most volatile region.


Syrians who are racing toward Turkey in search of refuge represent Erdogan’s most immediate challenge. Turkey has become not just a safe haven, but a model for what many Arabs would like to see their countries become. This model — a government with roots in Islam but also committed to democracy, free enterprise, and good relations with Europe and the United States — represents the dream of millions of Tunisians, Libyans, Egyptians, Yemenis, Syrians, Jordanians, and Palestinians.


Finding a way to stabilize the ever-more-turbulent Middle East is Turkey’s most urgent task. Erdogan is obsessed with his drive to make Turkey one of the world’s 10 biggest economies (it is now 17th). This will only be possible if the Middle East is peaceful and open for business.


Besides dealing with upheaval in the Arab world, Turkey faces three other key foreign policy challenges. First is the continuing division of Cyprus between ethnic Greek and Turkish sectors. Second is the frozen conflict with Armenia, which seemed to be on the brink of resolution until Turkish and Armenian nationalists killed a promising agreement reached by both countries two years ago. Erdogan’s new mandate gives him the power to overrule militants in his ranks. If he does, and if Armenian leaders can do the same, the entire region will benefit.


Third is to rebuild relations with Israel. Erdogan has become a hero in the Middle East for his forthright denunciations of Israel’s occupation of the West Bank and its blockade of Gaza. Like many Turks, he is still enraged over the murder of nine Turkish civilians by Israeli commandos who stormed a freighter bearing relief supplies for Gaza last year. His anger may be justified by the facts, but he should realize that a resumption of Turkey’s good ties to Israel could be a decisive step toward Middle East peace.


Foreign policy challenges are only part of Erdogan’s post-election agenda. He also needs to deepen Turkish democracy. That would require resolving the decades-old Kurdish conflict and taking concrete steps to reassure secular Turks that their country is not moving toward religious rule.


Turkey’s grand project in the next couple of years will be writing a new constitution to replace the one imposed by generals three decades ago. Erdogan wants to replace the current parliamentary system with one built around a strong president and then run for the presidency himself. His party did not win enough seats in Parliament to impose a constitution on its own, so if he wants to make such a radical change, he will have to propose a constitution that represents a national consensus. That can only be reached if the constitution includes strong guarantees of free speech, rights for women, judicial independence, and cultural freedom for all ethnic and religious groups.


Such a constitution would embody the wishes of most Turks. It might also reinvigorate Turkey’s stalled campaign to join the European Union. If Turkey becomes an EU member by the time it celebrates its 100th anniversary in 2023, that would be Erdogan’s eternal legacy.


Turkey is poised to become one of the most successful countries of the 21st century, a model of Muslim democracy and a powerful force for regional peace. Whether it will fulfill its potential depends largely on how Erdogan handles the mandate he has just won.

Why Syria will get away with it


Gideon Rachman





June 13 2011 --  late last week, Robert Gates, the US defence secretary, launched an offensive of his own. In a speech in Brussels, he dismissed most of America’s European allies as a useless bunch of timewasters. I paraphrase  but not much. 


Mr Gates pointed out that while all Nato countries had voted to intervene in Libya, most had chosen not to participate in the actual fighting. Even those European countries that are taking part began to run short of munitions just 11 weeks into the fighting – forcing an exasperated America to step into the breach. More broadly, a situation in which the US accounts for 75 per cent of the military spending in Nato was “unacceptable” and unsustainable. If it is not rectified, Mr Gates predicted, Nato faces a “dismal” future.


The conjunction of the Gates speech and the Syrian civil war is very telling. It explains why a 20-year experiment with the idea that western military force can put the world to rights is coming to a close. 


Just a few weeks ago, that would have seemed a surprising conclusion. Supporters of “liberal interventionism” hailed the decision to bomb Colonel Gaddafis forces in Libya as evidence of a longed-for new era, in which dictators can no longer feel free to massacre their own people. 


However a western failure to intervene, as the Syrian army brutalises and kills its own citizens, is likely to be a more accurate guide to the future than the Libyan campaign. There is, of course, a direct link between the west’s reluctance to get involved in Syria and the frustrating and (so far) inconclusive nature of the Libyan intervention. 


However, the Syrian conflict also needs to be seen in the context of a generation-long experiment with liberal interventionism. That era began in 1991, when the collapse of the Soviet Union left the US as the world’s sole superpower and a swift victory in the first Gulf war restored confidence in the power and effectiveness of American military might. Since then, the debate about how and when to use military power has waxed and waned. Western governments chastised themselves over the failure to protect the Kurds and the Shia in Iraq in 1991, over the Rwandan genocide of 1994 and over the many years of dithering as lives were lost in the Balkans. But a series of apparently successful interventions – Bosnia, Kosovo, East Timor, Sierra Leone – gradually strengthened the belief that western military power could be used to end conflicts and save civilians.


The bitter experiences of the Afghan and Iraq wars, however, shifted the debate on military intervention once more. Both Barack Obama in the US and David Cameron in Britain promised to be leaders who would adopt a much more cautious attitude to foreign military adventures. Then along came the Arab spring and western leaders once again found themselves committing to military action, this time in Libya – Mr Obama with evident reluctance, Mr Cameron and President Nicolas Sarkozy of France with apparent enthusiasm.


The Libyan war illustrates how unfolding events can force a political leader’s hand. That could still happen in Syria. But it seems much more likely that, this time, the west will stand aside. 


In part, this is because of deadlock at the UN, where Russia and China  angry about the Libyan war  are blocking efforts to pass a resolution that even condemns events in Syria, let alone prepares the ground for intervention. However the broader context is the west’s diminishing ability and willingness to intervene at all.


The Gates speech effectively marks the end of the American ambition to turn Nato into the global, military arm of a unified western world. The Americans have flirted with this idea, ever since the onset of the “war on terror”. But, as the Afghan war has worn on, so the military effort has become more and more heavily dependent on the US. 


The fact that Europeans called for a campaign in Libya that they are incapable of conducting alone has merely re-enforced the American view that the European arm of Nato is, to varying degrees, feckless and unreliable. Disarray and recriminations within Nato hobble the single most effective potential tool for western military intervention overseas.


Even more significant in the long run is the American anxiety that budgetary constraints, which are leading to defence cuts in Europe, are beginning to be replicated in the US itself. Admiral Michael Mullen, America’s top military officer, has called the budget deficit the single biggest threat to US national security. It is also the single biggest constraint on future bouts of “liberal interventionism”.


Money is not the only problem, however. Over the past 20 years it has become apparent that swiftly agreed-upon military actions can lead to entanglements that last for many years. There is still a Nato mission in Kosovo and an EU military mission in Bosnia, more than a decade after the fighting ended in both places. 


As for Afghanistan – that conflict has now lasted almost twice as long as the second world war. Western governments are also only beginning to come to terms with what may soon be required in Libya. Against this background, there are very few takers for yet another military venture – this time in Syria.

The American Interest


The Conservative Revolutionary


Walter Russell Mead 





June 12, 2011 -- The United States is the most revolutionary power in the history of the world, but after more than 200 years of a brilliant revolutionary career we are still not very good at understanding or responding to the revolutions our example, our ideas, our economy and our technology do so much to create.


The Arab spring is the latest example of the clash between America’s revolutionary world role and our pathetic cluelessness about the forces we do so much to promote.  The Arab Spring is turning into a long, hot summer.  Civil wars in Libya, Syria and Yemen and the sullen silence of the Shi’a in Bahrain have baptized Arab democracy in blood.  More will flow — and American foreign policy is befuddled and bemused.


None of the experts look particularly smart at the moment.  The ‘realists’ who counseled President Obama to forget George W. Bush’s support of Middle Eastern democracy and cultivate our relations with regional despots like Hosni Mubarak, the Iranian mullahs and the younger Assad have been sent back to the benches in disgrace.  Their counsel is now seen as both morally dubious and pragmatically unwise; the ‘realists’ would have put the US on the wrong side of history in the service of unrealistic assumptions about the stability of despotic regimes.


But the idealists who seek to replace them already have egg on their faces.  “Days, not weeks” is what they promised the President when he began to bomb for democracy in Libya.  The democratic revolution in Egypt is looking less democratic by the day; it looks more and more as if the Army used public unrest to block the Mubarak family’s attempt to turn Egypt into a family possession.  The Army has ruled Egypt since the overthrow of King Farouk, playing liberals and religious conservatives off against each other.  It looks set to go on doing that for some time to come.  In Yemen, Bahrain and Syria, the counsel of the idealists seems dark and confused.  US policy overall seems to have found the ‘sour spot’ that is the particular curse of the Obama administration: too friendly to the revolt to earn the trust and gratitude of the despots, too cautious and compromising to win many friends on the street.


Overall I am more cautious than optimistic about where the Arab Spring is headed.  There is little prospect for the kind of rapid economic growth that could improve the prospects for young unemployed and underemployed Arabs.  Foreign investment and tourism have already been badly hit by the unrest of the last six months, and the Arab regimes are turning to aid donors and organizations like the IMF and the World Bank in increasing desperation.


Culturally, many of the necessary preconditions are not in place.  The poor quality of most Arab universities, the limited access to serious political history and discourse among all but a handful of Arab intellectuals, the suppression of political life under past dictatorships, the weakness of Islamic political thought in recent centuries and the absence of a robust and deeply rooted tradition of Islamic democracy all work against the rapid widespread development of stable liberal democracy in the Arab world.


Putting the dark economic outlook together with the problematic cultural and political situation makes optimism a tough position to hold.  Without in any way scanting or minimizing the idealism, dedication and vision of the democrats rising in the Arab world today, they still seem a long way from winning.  They remind me still of the Marquis de Lafayette during the French Revolution: they believe in all the right ideas, but their countries aren’t ready for the vision they seek to promote.  They can help make a revolution but others will, for a time at least, determine the flow of events.


If true, then both the realists and the idealists are wrong about the Arab Revolution.  The realists are wrong that despotic regimes can provide long term stability in the region; the idealists are wrong that the fall of the old despots will lead to liberal democratic states.


Americans have been getting foreign revolutions wrong for more than 200 years.  It began with the French Revolution.  Enthusiasts like Thomas Jefferson initially thought they saw France following in America’s footsteps.  Then came the Reign of Terror, Napoleon, and a generation of brutal war.


Many Americans responded with the same generous enthusiasm to the South American revolutions against colonial rule.  Once again, those revolutions failed to establish anything like liberal democratic rule.


The cycles of revolution — 1830, 1848, 1917-20, 1946-1960 (decolonization), 1989-91, 2003-5 and now 2011 — catch Americans flatfooted over and over again.  We are surprised when they occur, and we are surprised when they fail to follow the course we expect.


Delusional Realists


The realists are half right: most revolutions will not bring about stable democratic societies.  But realists get the other half wrong; revolution is a basic fact of modern life and the kind of ‘stability’ that old fashioned diplomats long for is just a mirage.  American foreign policy cannot proceed on the assumption that despotic, frozen regimes will last.  They won’t.  Sooner or later they will come crashing down — and as the pace of technological and social change around the world continues to accelerate, such revolutionary upheavals are likely to become more frequent.


There is another problem with realism.  Like it or not, the United States is a revolutionary power.  Whether our government is trying to overthrow foreign dictators is almost irrelevant; American society is the most revolutionary force on the planet.  The Internet is more subversive than the CIA in its prime.  The dynamism of American society is constantly creating new businesses, new technologies, new ideas and new social models.  These innovations travel, and they make trouble when they do.  Saudi conservatives know that whatever geopolitical arrangements the Saudi princes make with the American government, the American people are busily undermining the core principles of Saudi society.  It’s not just our NGOs educating Saudi women and civil society activists; it’s not just the impact of American college life on the rising generation of the Saudi elite.  We change the world even when we aren’t thinking anything about global revolution — when Hollywood and rap musicians are just trying to make a buck, they are stoking the fires of change around the world.


A revolutionary nation cannot make a conservative foreign policy work for long.  In the 1820s and 1830s Washington tried to reassure the Mexican government that it had no hostile designs against Mexican territory.  But the American people were moving into Texas and the US government couldn’t stop that movement or blunt the threat to Mexico if it tried.  In the same way today, the economic and political activity of individual Americans and American companies is changing the world in ways that make life much harder for governments in countries like Russia, China and Saudi Arabia.  We can press all the reset buttons with Russia that we want, but the Russian government will still notice that both US society and sometimes the government are actively working to help foreign subversives overthrow repressive regimes.


Feckless Idealists


If the desire of our realists to conduct foreign policy with foreign despots as if unprincipled cooperation with the bad guys could build a stable world is unrealistic, the idealism of our enthusiasts that every new foreign revolution will bring a millennium of democratic peace is absurd.


American foreign policy cannot expect that revolutions in foreign countries will rescue us from the painful dilemmas our foreign policy often confronts. Revolution is not the deus ex machina that will make the world peaceful; it is a tsunami that sweeps everything before it, and often leaves the world messier and more dangerous.


Modern history teaches two great lessons about revolution: that revolutions are inevitable, and that a large majority of revolutions either fail or go bad.  Americans almost instinctively look at revolutions in terms of our own past: the 1688 Glorious Revolution that made Parliament more powerful than the King in  England, and the American Revolution that led in relatively short order to the establishment of a stable and constitutional government.


Most revolutions don’t work like this at all.  Many of them fail, with the old despots crushing dissent or making only cosmetic changes to the old system.  (This happened in Austria in 1848 and something very like it may be happening in Egypt today.)  Others move into radicalism, terror and mob rule before a new despot comes along to bring order — at least until the next futile and bloody revolutionary spasm.  That was France’s history for almost 100 years after the storming of the Bastille.  China, Russia and Iran all saw revolutions like this in the 20th century.


The revolutions that ‘work’ are the exceptions, not the rule.  The peaceful revolutions in the Central European countries as Soviet power melted in 1989-1990 are a unique exception to the rule that most revolutions either turn nasty or fail.  When many American idealists think about revolution today, they have Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary in mind.


Few assumptions can lead you into as much trouble this quickly.  Even in 1989-90, those countries were the exception and not the rule.  Think Ukraine, Belarus, Yugoslavia, Romania, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and of course Russia itself.  More people live in countries where the 1989-90 revolutionary wave failed to establish secure constitutional democracy than live in those where it succeeded.


More, the countries that had ‘velvet’ revolutions shared a number of important characteristics.  They had or longed to have close political and cultural ties to the West.  They wanted to join NATO and the EU, and had a reasonable confidence of doing so sooner rather than later.  They could expect enormous amounts of aid and foreign direct investment if they continued along the path of democratic reform.  They lay on the ‘western’ side of the ancient division of Europe between the Orthodox east and the Catholic/Protestant homeland of the modern liberal tradition.


No Arab country looks anything like this.  Indeed, most seem closer to Yugoslavia and Belarus or, at best, Ukraine.  We, and they, may get lucky, and the revolutions in the Arab world may lead to something that looks more like Central Europe than like Central Asia.  That would be a nice surprise, but we should not be placing large bets that this will actually happen.


China, by the way, does not look very much like the Czech Republic.  Revolution there is very unlikely to produce a US or European style democracy anytime soon.


If realists ignore the inevitability of revolution, idealists close their eyes to the problems of revolutionary upheavals in societies that have difficult histories, deep social divisions, and poor short term economic prospects.  Unfortunately the countries most likely to experience revolutions are usually the countries that lack the preconditions for Anglo-American style relatively peaceful revolutions that end with the establishment of stable constitutional order.  If things were going well in those countries, they would not be having revolutions.


Historically, revolutions in foreign countries are both necessary for their political development and inevitable.  They often tend to make American foreign policy more difficult — and the world more dangerous.  On the evidence so far, this is the pattern we are seeing in the Middle East today.


Revolutionary Realism?


The difficulty American policymakers have in coming to grips with the recurring phenomenon of foreign revolutions is rooted in America’s paradoxical world role.  We are not just the world’s leading revolutionary nation; we are also the chief custodian of the international status quo.  We are upholding the existing balance of power and the international system of finance and trade with one hand, but the American agenda in the world ultimately aims to transform rather than to defend.


It is harder to be an effective revolutionary power than to be a conservative one — and it is harder still to combine the two roles.


A traditional conservative power knows what it wants.  Revolutionary powers have a tougher job; building the future is harder work than holding on to the past.  This is particularly true in the American case; the global transformation we seek is unparalleled for depth, complexity and scale.


We are not sure how this revolutionary transformation works.  We know that it involves liberal political change: governments of law rather than of men and legitimacy derived from the consent of the governed as measured in regular and free elections.  We also know that involves intellectual and social change: traditional religious ideas must make room for the equality of the sexes and the rights of religious minorities.  Property rights must be rooted in law and protected by an independent judicial system.  While governments have a role in the economy, the mechanisms of the market must ultimately be allowed to work their way.


We do not agree among ourselves about the proper sequence of these changes.  We know that in the short run, democratic voting procedures may not produce liberal governments.  We know that demagogues and aspiring despots can use the language and even the mechanisms of democracy to build personal dictatorships (Napoleon III and Hugo Chavez, for example).  We know that popular opinion is sometimes more nationalistic than elite opinion and that gains for democracy do not always lead to more foreign policy cooperation.  In most cases, progress toward stable and peaceful democratic government comes slowly if it comes at all; even if you believe in ‘democratic peace theory, hoping that the democratization of other countries will solve American foreign policy problems is a fool’s game.


Yet we also know — or at least we believe — that in the long run a more democratic world is a better if not always a safer world, and that it would be immoral as well as impractical to stand in the way of the changes that need to come.


If we add the conservative mission of the United States to the revolutionary agenda, the problems of American foreign policy become more complex still.  We are trying to carry out a vast reordering of global society even as we preserve the stability of the international political order: we are trying to walk blindfolded on a tightrope across Niagara Falls — while changing our clothes.


The uncertainties and risks that surround us should not be underestimated.  There has never been a worldwide revolution of this kind before; nobody knows for sure how best to speed the plow.  Nobody has ever had to balance transformational and conservative roles on a global scale before.


From an American point of view, the Arab Spring is just another complication of this global task — a sudden thunderstorm with flashes of lightening, driving rain and unpredictable gusts of wind as we hop one-legged on the tightrope changing our pants.  The Islamic world is entering new territory as it struggles to integrate religious and liberal political values; as the United States tries to juggle its geopolitical interests with its values at a volatile moment in world history, we are almost certain to get the balance wrong much of the time.


Here, however, history offers some hope.  As I wrote at the beginning of this post, the United States has been doing two things for more than 200 years: getting foreign revolutions wrong, but somehow still pushing its global revolution forward.  America’s success as a conservative revolutionary power on a global scale depends less on the clever policies of our presidents and our secretaries of state, and more on the creativity and dynamism of American society as a whole.


It is power of a free people more than the brilliance of our intellectual and social establishment that has brought the United States this far; in that truth lies the secret of our revolution and of our success.

Iran Without Nukes


Roger Cohen





June 13, 2011 — Remember Iran? 


I do. It’s been two years since the Iranian people rose up to protest a stolen election with a bravery that stirred the world and presented Americans with a truer image of a young and highly educated nation than the old specter of the bearded Islamic zealot. The Green Movement was suppressed through barbaric violence but its example helped kindle the Arab Spring. 


As Hamid Dabashi of Columbia University wrote in July, 2009: “Tehran, I believe, is ground zero of a civil rights movement that will leave no Muslim or Arab country, or even Israel, untouched.” He added, “The moving pictures of Iranians flooding colorfully into the streets have forever altered the visual vocabulary of the global perception of ‘the Middle East.”’ 


Seldom were there more prescient words. 


They were quoted by Nader Hashemi of the University of Denver in a recent talk on Iran, in which he noted shared Iranian and Arab aims: “Democracy and dignity, the rule of law and respect for basic human rights, political transparency and an end to corruption.” 


That urge is still powerful in Iran beneath the opaque, directionless apparatus of the Islamic Republic. Iran is weak now, its ideology as tired as Osama Bin Laden’s, as marginal to peoples questing to reconcile their Muslim faith and modernity in new ways. 


I would probe this weakness through new approaches. But we are stuck still with the world’s most paranoid relationship: the American-Iranian relationship. That’s largely because there’s another way to remember Iran — as the Godot of nuclear threats, the country always on the verge of producing a nuclear weapon or acquiring the “breakout capacity” to make one, but never, despite the dire warning of Israeli leaders dating back to the 1990s, doing either, preferring to dwell in the Islamic Republic’s favored zones: ambivalence and inertia. As one awaits this tortuous Godot, one might recall a forecast of a bomb by 1999 (Shimon Peres) or 2004 (Ehud Barak), or Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s talk of “a messianic apocalyptic cult controlling atomic bombs,” or my friend Jeffrey Goldberg’s allusion in The Atlantic last year to a “consensus” that there is “a better than 50 percent chance that Israel will launch a strike by next July.” That would be next month. 


It might also be worth recalling that Meir Dagan, the former head of Israel’s Mossad spy agency, declared last month that attacking Iran would be “a stupid idea.” He suggested his main worry was not Iran itself but Netanyahu’s susceptibility to “dangerous adventure.” 


Dagan’s concerns have surfaced as Seymour Hersh concludes in a New Yorker article this month that, as he put it in one interview, “There’s just no serious evidence inside that Iran is actually doing anything to make a nuclear weapon.” 


His reporting reveals that the U.S. National Intelligence Estimate (N.I.E.) of 2007 — which concluded “with high confidence” that Iran had halted a nuclear-weapons program in 2003 — still pertains in the classified N.I.E. of 2011. As a retired senior intelligence official put it to Hersh, there’s nothing “substantially new” that “leads to a bomb.” 


In other words, Iran, epicenter of inefficiency, unable to produce a kilowatt of electricity through its Bushehr nuclear reactor despite decades of effort, is still doing its old brinkmanship number. 


Remember, Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader, is the guardian of the revolution. That is a conservative business. Breakout, let alone a bomb, is a bridge too far if the Islamic Republic is what you’ve vowed to preserve. Much better to gain leverage by producing low-enriched uranium — far from weapons grade — under International Atomic Energy Agency inspection and allow rumors to swirl. 


So Iran, long at the top of the Washington agenda, has slid down. It’s partly the Arab Spring. It’s partly that you can’t keep saying the same thing. People do begin to remember the refrain, although nobody in the large Iran-the-clear-and-present-danger school ever seems to get called to account. They should be. The nuclear bogeyman obsession has been a distraction from the need to try to tease out a relationship with Tehran, see Iran as it is. Only the most flimsy efforts have been made, insufficient to test the waters. 


Those waters are troubled. The Islamic Republic has not recovered from its convulsion of 2009. It is sickly, consumed by hypocrisy as it cheers on some brave Arabs (but not those in Syria) while brutalizing its own seekers of the freedom promised in 1979. Arabs aren’t buying Iranian hypocrisy. Only Iran’s command of Revolutionary Guard force and the opposition’s lack of a shared goal salvage it. 


Khamenei is at loggerheads with President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who got into such a sulk recently that he took 11 days off work, infuriating everybody. The Majlis, or parliament, is investigating Ahmadinejad for various alleged frauds including, of all things, vote-buying in 2009! Ahmadinejad was booed during his June 3 speech commemorating Ayatollah Khomeini’s death. Iran is characterized by what Farideh Farhi of the University of Hawaii recently termed “administrative chaos.” 


That’s not how you make a nuke. When remembering Iran — and it must be remembered — call the fear-mongers to account.

NATIONAL REVIEW


Interview with - Francis Fukuyama:  The Difficulty of Political Order


Matthew Shaffer











MATTHEW SHAFFER: Origins is a historical work, as opposed to previous works, such as The End of History, and Our Posthuman Future, which were more theoretical. What, for you, is the prescriptive value of history?



FRANCIS FUKUYAMA: This really started with a practical concern I had after dealing with failed states and nation-building issues in the wake of September 11 and our nation-building efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq. It seemed to me that the United States in particular didn’t appreciate the difficulty of this kind of activity, because we didn’t adequately understand how hard it was to establish institutions. When I was at Johns Hopkins at SAIS [School of Advanced International Studies] I ran an international-development program, focusing on issues of anti-corruption and improving governance. And a lot of it seemed premised on an overly optimistic faith in the ability of outsiders to effect desired outcomes. So I decided to write a book about where institutions came from in countries that had them and could take them for granted. We’ve forgotten a lot of that history and how we’ve gotten to the present. Along the way it was also a means of revisiting a lot of The End of History 20 years later.
 




SHAFFER: Some theorists, like Hegel, think that history doesn’t just tell us what is stable, or what works, but actually points us toward moral progress. Do you believe that?




FUKUYAMA: Fundamentally, I believe in liberal democracy, that it’s the best form of government, and that the world has made moral progress. But that’s a separate question from whether the development of democratic institutions is inevitable and driven by an underlying historical force. I’ve become more skeptical of that latter belief over the years as I’ve become more attentive to the role of accident and contingency. And my current book is about a lot of that. For example: The reason we got to democracy in Europe is the almost accidental survival of a feudal institution — the English parliament — into the modern period. That’s something that didn’t happen in other European countries, and which we therefore can’t take for granted. So, as you see, the normative concern is separate from the empirical question of whether democracy is inevitable.
 




SHAFFER: Origins incorporates economics, anthropology, philosophy, and social psychology, for lessons about political order. Is that kind of study too rare today?




FUKUYAMA: This is partly the fault of the structure of academia. There’s such a premium placed on specialization and narrowness that it’s very hard to think more broadly and to cross disciplinary boundaries. I work at Stanford in an interdisciplinary institute, and I’ve been associated with these kinds of outfits for most of my years. And those are where the most interesting research gets done.
 




SHAFFER: What field outside of political science has the most important insights for understanding political order?




FUKUYAMA: That’s hard to say. I don’t know if there is one. Part of the problem is economics — it’s a very important discipline, but in a way it’s colonized the rest of the social sciences. A lot of political analysis in academia is driven by this model of everybody being a rational decision maker driven by more or less material interests. There’s obviously something to that, but it’s a very limited way of looking about politics, which is about dignity and values and ideas that can’t be explained in material terms. Other disciplines — sociology and anthropology — have gotten at those things better than economics has.
 




SHAFFER: Your chapter “How Christianity Undermines the Family” is provocatively titled and sort of microcosmic for your whole thesis. Can you tell us about it?




FUKUYAMA: You can’t have modern politics if society is based on the biological principles of supporting friends and family. That’s the natural mode of human sociability. We’re naturally inclined to take care of family and exchange favors with friends. Human beings will interact in that manner without anyone telling them to behave that way because it’s biologically grounded.




In all human societies, social order at one stage depended on extended kinship — people living in tribes where people traced ancestry to a common ancestor that may be three, four, or five generations dead. This was no less true of Europeans than it was of the Chinese, or Arabs, or Africans, or anyone else in the world. All the Germanic barbarians organized themselves tribally after overrunning the Roman Empire.

One of the broad questions I’ve addressed in the book is how did these different societies make an exit out of kinship-based social organization into a modern-based state, with impersonal, centralized administration? Europe in that respect was quite exceptional, because that happened early, and it happened through the agency of the Catholic Church, which changed the rules of inheritance for kin-groups. It forbade divorce, it forbade concubinage, and it forbade cousin marriages within three or four degrees of relatedness. All of these were practices in tribal societies that kept property within an extended kin-group. In the Arab world in many places they still encourage cross-cousin marriage, where you marry your first cousin and the two families get to keep property within this narrow circle.




When the Catholic Church [forbade cousin marriage] in the eighth century, it wasn’t thinking about the effect on kinship. It was acting in a self-interested way, because by cutting off these ways of kin-groups’ keeping property, the Church ended up being the beneficiary. So if a woman didn’t marry and didn’t have children but had a big estate, she tended to donate it to the Church. So the Church helped effect in Europe the breakdown of extended kinship very, very early. Even in the beginning of the Middle Ages, people owned property as individuals. Women could hold property — they could sell it, alienate it, in ways that they still can’t in parts of the Arab world. And this meant that individualism became very deeply rooted in European society. So some individualism was already established by the time Europe got to feudalism. And feudalism is basically a contract — it’s one that is very hierarchical, between a stronger and weaker person, but it is a contract between two people.




So the idea of exchange and private property dates way, way back, hundreds of years before the Enlightenment, Reformation, etc. So I think that the basis for European modernization traces all the way back to developments like that. In China, in India, the exit out of kinship was accomplished through political power, via a state that tried to create impersonal government layered on top of a kin-based society. And those kin-groups really never went away. Even in contemporary China and India, in certain parts there are still kin-groups that influence politics.
 




SHAFFER: But China had an impersonal government — a meritocratic bureaucracy — without Christianity, and long before the West did, yes?




FUKUYAMA: So you have to understand what that means. China didn’t create the first state, it created the first modern state, meaning a state which recruited people into a centralized bureaucracy based on talent and merit, essentially, and not based on family relations, or connections to the household of the emperor, or something of that sort. So it had a modern form of public administration. And this was all consolidated by the third century B.C. But what the country never got to was the rule of law. Up to the modern day, the concept of a sovereign being limited by the rule of law never existed. So what that meant is that at a very early period in their history, the Chinese perfected strong, absolutist government. And that’s been a consistent pattern — high-quality, authoritarian government. And I think that continues up to the present.
 




SHAFFER: Could we trace Western ascendance to that one factor, the rule of law?




FUKUYAMA: That’s what’s interesting about the present period. A lot of economic theory says you can’t have modern economic growth without Western-style rule of law. Economists who believe this are thinking about two critical things — property rights and contract enforcement. And there’s a lot of theory and a lot of empirical evidence that show that these are in fact important. The problem with that theory is that it doesn’t really square with the facts in contemporary China. As everybody knows, for the past three decades, China has been growing at double-digit rates and they don’t have Western rule of law.




I think you can rescue the theory in the long run, because without rule of law they can’t keep this up. In a way the challenge that contemporary China poses it that they are doing well, and in the short run they’re doing better than the United States without having these Western institutions. The real challenge is the long-run sustainability of that system, or of the two systems. And looking at that in the long-run, I would still bet on the West, with its rule of law and systems of checks and balances on authority.




SHAFFER: You’ve probably heard a lot of phony rebuttals based on misreading of The End of History. So, I won’t attempt one — but you’ve made oblique references to your own revisions and criticisms. How does the rise of China and the current Arab unrest, for example, fit into the end of history?




FUKUYAMA: If you understand the original thesis correctly, what I was saying is that there was a theory of history among progressive intellectuals for most of the 20th century. That theory of history was Marxism. And according to the Marxists, the end of history was a communist utopia. My observation in the late 1980s is that we weren’t going to get there. Liberal democracies seemed to be the highest stage of political development, and I didn’t see any real alternatives. If you understand the thesis that way, I still believe that. Nothing that’s happened in the last 20 years has convinced me that there’s a higher form of government. Certainly not 9/11 — I don’t think anybody wants to live in a place like Iran and Afghanistan, so I don’t think that’s a serious competitor. China is a more plausible alternative. But I don’t think that anybody who’s not culturally Chinese would duplicate their system, and the Chinese are not really proselytizing their system. So I still think liberal democracy is the default form of government.




What’s changed for me are a couple of things: One is the idea of political decay. It wasn’t an important part of the End of History. But I do think that all political systems, including liberal democracies, can decay over time. They can get too rigid, they can fail to adapt, and if they do, then they’re going to get into trouble, just like authoritarian systems. The other issue, which we’ve already touched on, is contingency in history. So the route to getting into modernity is, I now think, full of a lot of accident, and so it’s not as if there’s this inevitable historical process that driving us toward the present. I think it should make us both more appreciative of the fact that we’ve gotten to the present and also more aware of the fragility of modern institutions.
 




SHAFFER: A lot of people have related that — your focus on the contingency of political order, and our ability to construct democracies — to your “falling-out” with neoconservatism. Was that “falling out” just local to some of the failures and disappointments of the Bush years or was it a break with the intellectual project as a whole?




FUKUYAMA: It was more a practical dispute over methods. I didn’t think U.S. hard power was an effective method [for advancing liberal democracy], and the Bush administration hadn’t really thought through the implications of invading Iraq. I still think there are ways that the United States can help promote democracy, but it’s a slow and long-term process. For example, I’m on the board of the National Endowment for Democracy, which had an important role in supporting solidarity in Poland in the 1980s, and in Serbia, and the Orange Coalition in Ukraine. So there are ways in which we’ve encouraged democratic forces around the world. I still believe in that mission and project. But I don’t think the Bush administration actually invaded Iraq to promote democracy. They had security objectives in mind, and they added the democracy argument as an afterthought, and that’s what stuck in people’s minds. That was a mistake, because it kind of undermined the notion of democracy promotion, simply because it was connected to a very unpopular intervention.




SHAFFER: Taking lessons from that, what can we do to promote democracy in the aftermath of the “Arab Spring”?




FUKUYAMA: We already are doing a lot. We’ve got organizations like the National Democratic Institute, or the International Republican Institute, that are all over Tunisia and Egypt and Libya, and other places, trying to help them organize political parties, trade unions, civil-society organizations, that hopefully will allow the more Western-oriented democrats in those Arab countries to actually contest in the elections. As we move toward votes in Tunisia and Egypt we want to have some alternative to the Muslim Brotherhood and the military. So we’re giving them that kind of assistance right now. That’s difficult, because they haven’t had experience with democracy previously.




It’s a long-term struggle, and I think we’ll be disappointed in the short run. I don’t think the more pro-Western forces are the ones that will end up on top in the short-run. But we’ve got to start somewhere.




SHAFFER: Is the spread of liberal democracy dependent upon persisting American hegemony?




FUKUYAMA: It’s been helpful. The U.S. obviously plays a big role in maintaining a liberal, open world order, through its alliances and the influence it projects. And American ideas have been very dominant in the world especially in the last two decades. A lot of that is shifting now because of the rise of other powers and other ideas. But the idea of liberal democracy — the U.S. is not the only exemplar of liberal democracy — [remains]. It’s a powerful idea that would exist independently of whether the U.S. is hegemonic or not.




I’m not as scared of a world without American hegemony as some people are. We went through the whole Cold War period in which the U.S. was one of two superpowers. A return to a more multi-polar world in certain ways induces a fair amount of moderation among big players in the system, because people know they can’t get their way unilaterally. And in the more multi-polar world we’d probably think twice about doing things like Iraq. The more important question is: In the global marketplace of ideas, how dominant will American ideas about freedom and rule of law and democracy and our economic model be? Our ideas will obviously be challenged; and it’s important for the U.S. to put its own house in order, both politically and economically, because that’s the most important way we exercise influence around the world: The model we set.
 




SHAFFER: To revisit Our Posthuman Future, are there any developments in bio-technologies in the past nine years that you find particularly disturbing?




FUKUYAMA: Yes. The whole rise of synthetic biology, where we’ve had new forms of life, and the ability to do new forms of life is proceeding extremely rapidly. The creation of an artificial bacteria itself is not immediately threatening, but it’s part of a long-term process by which we’ll uncover the technologies for manufacturing life, in ways that could have very serious security and moral implications.
 




SHAFFER: Don’t bioethics pose a challenge to the idea that the best society is the most successful society? You argue in Our Posthuman Future that a society that genetically engineered its children to be more intelligent might be more productive and successful but wouldn’t be moral.




FUKUYAMA: I’ve got a simpler concern in my current book. It’s just that liberal democracy is not something you can take for granted, or that democracies will find a way to solve their problems. I think we’ve got a number of long-term problems in the United States that don’t seem to be getting addressed with the current political system.

Does Anything Matter?


Peter Singer





2011-06-13 – Can moral judgments be true or false? Or is ethics, at bottom, a purely subjective matter, for individuals to choose, or perhaps relative to the culture of the society in which one lives? We might have just found out the answer.


Among philosophers, the view that moral judgments state objective truths has been out of fashion since the 1930’s, when logical positivists asserted that, because there seems to be no way of verifying the truth of moral judgments, they cannot be anything other than expressions of our feelings or attitudes. So, for example, when we say, “You ought not to hit that child,” all we are really doing is expressing our disapproval of your hitting the child, or encouraging you to stop hitting the child. There is no truth to the matter of whether or not it is wrong for you to hit the child.


Although this view of ethics has often been challenged, many of the objections have come from religious thinkers who appealed to God’s commands. Such arguments have limited appeal in the largely secular world of Western philosophy. Other defenses of objective truth in ethics made no appeal to religion, but could make little headway against the prevailing philosophical mood.


Last month, however, saw a major philosophical event: the publication of Derek Parfit’s long-awaited book On What Matters. Until now, Parfit, who is Emeritus Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, had written only one book, Reasons and Persons, which appeared in 1984, to great acclaim. Parfit’s entirely secular arguments, and the comprehensive way in which he tackles alternative positions, have, for the first time in decades, put those who reject objectivism in ethics on the defensive.


On What Matters is a book of daunting length: two large volumes, totaling more than 1,400 pages, of densely argued text. But the core of the argument comes in the first 400 pages, which is not an insurmountable challenge for the intellectually curious – particularly given that Parfit, in the best tradition of English-language philosophy, always strives for lucidity, never using obscure words where simple ones will do. Each sentence is straightforward, the argument is clear, and Parfit often uses vivid examples to make his points. Thus, the book is an intellectual treat for anyone who wants to understand not so much “what matters” as whether anything really can matter, in an objective sense.


Many people assume that rationality is always instrumental: reason can tell us only how to get what we want, but our basic wants and desires are beyond the scope of reasoning. Not so, Parfit argues. Just as we can grasp the truth that 1 + 1 = 2, so we can see that I have a reason to avoid suffering agony at some future time, regardless of whether I now care about, or have desires about, whether I will suffer agony at that time. We can also have reasons (though not always conclusive reasons) to prevent others from suffering agony. Such self-evident normative truths provide the basis for Parfit’s defense of objectivity in ethics.


One major argument against objectivism in ethics is that people disagree deeply about right and wrong, and this disagreement extends to philosophers who cannot be accused of being ignorant or confused. If great thinkers like Immanuel Kant and Jeremy Bentham disagree about what we ought to do, can there really be an objectively true answer to that question?


Parfit’s response to this line of argument leads him to make a claim that is perhaps even bolder than his defense of objectivism in ethics. He considers three leading theories about what we ought to do – one deriving from Kant, one from the social-contract tradition of Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, and the contemporary philosophers John Rawls and T.M. Scanlon, and one from Bentham’s utilitarianism – and argues that the Kantian and social-contract theories must be revised in order to be defensible.


Then he argues that these revised theories coincide with a particular form of consequentialism, which is a theory in the same broad family as utilitarianism. If Parfit is right, there is much less disagreement between apparently conflicting moral theories than we all thought. The defenders of each of these theories are, in Parfit’s vivid phrase, “climbing the same mountain on different sides.”


Readers who go to On What Matters seeking an answer to the question posed by its title might be disappointed. Parfit’s real interest is in combating subjectivism and nihilism. Unless he can show that objectivism is true, he believes, nothing matters.


When Parfit does come to the question of “what matters,” his answer might seem surprisingly obvious. He tells us, for example, that what matters most now is that “we rich people give up some of our luxuries, ceasing to overheat the Earth’s atmosphere, and taking care of this planet in other ways, so that it continues to support intelligent life.”


Many of us had already reached that conclusion. What we gain from Parfit’s work is the possibility of defending these and other moral claims as objective truths.

The Daily Beast   Obama’s True Claim to Fame   Michael Tomasky       August 23, 2011 -- Barack Obama hasn’t been much of a domestic-policy president from nearly anyone’s point of view. And it’s a little hard to picture how he might ever be seen as such—that is to say, even if he’s reelected, he’ll probably have a Republican House or Senate (or both) that will thwart him at every turn, so the best he’ll be able to say is that he presided over a slow and very difficult economic recovery, which presumably will finally happen by January 2017. But foreign policy could be a completely different story. Here one can see how he might become not just a good but a great foreign-policy president. Yes, of course, let’s stipulate: the war isn’t actually, you know, over. And even after it is, Libya could descend into chaos or extremism or both (although it is heartening to read that the National Transitional Council, the recognized new governing body, apparently has detailed governance plans in place). So could Egypt, and Tunisia, and so on and so on. Lots of things could, can, and undoubtedly will go wrong. Let’s also stipulate that Obama did not drape himself only in glory on Libya. The administration’s statement in June that the conflict wasn’t under the purview of the War Powers Act because bombing didn’t constitute “hostilities” was ridiculous. And many critics reasonably felt back in March that Obama was a little slow to pull the trigger on the intervention (I didn’t share that view).   All that said, the administration has already handled a lot of these changes well (and in the face of absolutely constant know-it-all criticism). One of the best things an American administration can do when big changes are afoot somewhere in the world is stay out of the way and not act as if we can will an outcome just because we’re America. We have a group in this country that likes to will outcomes, and their track record demonstrates that that doesn’t work so well (unless you think, apropos Iraq, that eight years and more than 100,000 lives later defines “well”). Obama has been more in the mold of George H.W. Bush and his secretary of state, Jim Baker, when the Eastern bloc was throwing off Moscow’s shackles. Offer encouragement and stability, give a few speeches about freedom, but otherwise let them do their own work. Obama took a lot of stick for not being more forceful on Egypt in February, but he was right to be cautious—there were lots of stakeholders involved, and sorry, but the president of the United States just can’t say every sweet thing romantics would like him to say. He then, as noted, took heat for moving too slowly on Libya, but here again he was correct. The nature of the Libyan regime is not a direct national-security issue, so there absolutely had to be a specific trigger to justify acting. That trigger was Gaddafi’s threatened assault on Benghazi. That was completely the right thing to do. It was as textbook a fulfillment of “R2P,” or “responsibility to protect,” as one could imagine. The subsequent bombing campaign took longer than advertised, but it has apparently done the job, quickly and with far smaller loss of life (including zero U.S. deaths) than if we’d followed John McCain and Lindsey Graham’s advice and gone in with ground troops. One of the best things an American administration can do when big changes are afoot somewhere in the world is stay out of the way and not act as if we can will an outcome just because we’re America. Next comes Syria. Conservatives are pushing Obama to take stronger steps. Maybe he should. I argued back in the spring, before Obama imposed sanctions on Assad, that he needed to be more forceful. But now he has imposed those sanctions and said Assad should step down. Doing much more seems dubious. Bashar al-Assad will go. It’s a matter of when. Better to let it play out. If a true R2P situation arises, then Obama will have to make some decisions. But it’s far better to let the Syrians do this themselves, if they can. We cannot prevent every casualty.  That’s starting to sound like a doctrine to me. Call it the doctrine of no doctrine: using our power and influence but doing so prudently and multilaterally, with the crucial recognition that Egypt is different from Libya is different from Syria is different from someplace else. According to the foreign-policy establishment, if you want to have a self-respecting big-D doctrine, you’re not supposed to recognize differences. The doctrine must guide all cases. But that is exactly the kind of thinking that has led—always—to tragedy. The Truman Doctrine was never meant to be applied to Vietnam. The Bush Doctrine was applied to Iraq based on a series of lies told to the American people. And so on. If the Obama Doctrine is nothing like those, so much the better.   This does not yet greatness make. These dramatic changes have to work out for the better, and here the United States has a huge role to play. With respect to Libya, for example, we have control of about $37 billion in assets we can dole out to the transitional council. And yes, we probably are interested in its oil. But that doesn’t have to mean stealing it. All the Western countries that backed the rebels have to play a constructive and non- (forgive me for such a dated word) imperialist role in helping the country build its future.   So there’s work to be done. But it’s hardly impossible to envision an Obama administration in a few years’ time that has drawn down Afghanistan and Iraq, helped foster reforms and maybe even the growth of a couple of democracies around the Middle East, and restored the standing of a country that Bush had laid such staggering waste. And killed Osama bin Laden. If this is weak America-hating, count me in.

Stratfor   Israeli-Arab Crisis Approaching   George Friedman      August 22, 2011 -- In September, the U.N. General Assembly will vote on whether to recognize Palestine as an independent and sovereign state with full rights in the United Nations. In many ways, this would appear to be a reasonable and logical step. Whatever the Palestinians once were, they are clearly a nation in the simplest and most important sense - namely, they think of themselves as a nation. Nations are created by historical circumstances, and those circumstances have given rise to a Palestinian nation. Under the principle of the United Nations and the theory of the right to national self-determination, which is the moral foundation of the modern theory of nationalism, a nation has a right to a state, and that state has a place in the family of nations. In this sense, the U.N. vote will be unexceptional.   However, when the United Nations votes on Palestinian statehood, it will intersect with other realities and other historical processes. First, it is one thing to declare a Palestinian state; it is quite another thing to create one. The Palestinians are deeply divided between two views of what the Palestinian nation ought to be, a division not easily overcome. Second, this vote will come at a time when two of Israel's neighbors are coping with their own internal issues. Syria is in chaos, with an extended and significant resistance against the regime having emerged. Meanwhile, Egypt is struggling with internal tension over the fall of President Hosni Mubarak and the future of the military junta that replaced him. Add to this the U.S. withdrawal from Iraq and the potential rise of Iranian power, and the potential recognition of a Palestinian state - while perfectly logical in an abstract sense - becomes an event that can force a regional crisis in the midst of ongoing regional crises. It thus is a vote that could have significant consequences.   The Palestinian Divide   Let's begin with the issue not of the right of a nation to have a state but of the nature of a Palestinian state under current circumstances. The Palestinians are split into two major factions. The first, Fatah, dominates the West Bank. Fatah derives its ideology from the older, secular Pan-Arab movement. Historically, Fatah saw the Palestinians as a state within the Arab nation. The second, Hamas, dominates Gaza. Unlike Fatah, it sees the Palestinians as forming part of a broader Islamist uprising, one in which Hamas is the dominant Islamist force of the Palestinian people.   The Pan-Arab rising is moribund. Where it once threatened the existence of Muslim states, like the Arab monarchies, it is now itself threatened. Mubarak, Syrian President Bashar al Assad and Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi all represented the old Pan-Arab vision. A much better way to understand the "Arab Spring" is that it represented the decay of such regimes that were vibrant when they came to power in the late 1960s and early 1970s but have fallen into ideological meaninglessness. Fatah is part of this grouping, and while it still speaks for Palestinian nationalism as a secular movement, beyond that it is isolated from broader trends in the region. It is both at odds with rising religiosity and simultaneously mistrusted by the monarchies it tried to overthrow. Yet it controls the Palestinian proto-state, the Palestinian National Authority, and thus will be claiming a U.N. vote on Palestinian statehood. Hamas, on the other hand, is very much representative of current trends in the Islamic world and holds significant popular support, yet it is not clear that it holds a majority position in the Palestinian nation.   All nations have ideological divisions, but the Palestinians are divided over the fundamental question of the Palestinian nation's identity. Fatah sees itself as part of a secular Arab world that is on the defensive. Hamas envisions the Palestinian nation as an Islamic state forming in the context of a region-wide Islamist rising. Neither is in a position to speak authoritatively for the Palestinian people, and the things that divide them cut to the heart of the nation. As important, each has a different view of its future relations with Israel. Fatah has accepted, in practice, the idea of Israel's permanence as a state and the need of the Palestinians to accommodate themselves to the reality. Hamas has rejected it.   The U.N. decision raises the stakes in this debate within the Palestinian nation that could lead to intense conflict. As vicious as the battle between Hamas and Fatah has been, an uneasy truce has existed over recent years. Now, there could emerge an internationally legitimized state, and control of that state will matter more than ever before. Whoever controls the state defines what the Palestinians are, and it becomes increasingly difficult to suspend the argument for a temporary truce. Rather than settling anything, or putting Israel on the defensive, the vote will compel a Palestinian crisis.   Fatah has an advantage in any vote on Palestinian statehood: It enjoys far more international support than Hamas does. Europeans and Americans see it as friendly to their interests and less hostile to Israel. The Saudis and others may distrust Fatah from past conflicts, but in the end they fear radical Islamists and Iran and so require American support at a time when the Americans have tired of playing in what some Americans call the "sandbox." However reluctantly, while aiding Hamas, the Saudis are more comfortable with Fatah. And of course, the embattled Arabist regimes, whatever tactical shifts there may have been, spring from the same soil as Fatah. While Fatah is the preferred Palestinian partner for many, Hamas can also use that reality to portray Fatah as colluding with Israel against the Palestinian people during a confrontation.   For its part, Hamas has the support of Islamists in the region, including Shiite Iranians, but that is an explosive mix to base a strategy on. Hamas must break its isolation if it is to counter the tired but real power of Fatah. Symbolic flotillas from Turkey are comforting, but Hamas needs an end to Egyptian hostility to Hamas more than anything.   Egypt's Role and Fatah on the Defensive   Egypt is the power that geographically isolates Hamas through its treaty with Israel and with its still-functional blockade on Gaza. More than anyone, Hamas needs genuine regime change in Egypt. The new regime it needs is not a liberal democracy but one in which Islamist forces supportive of Hamas, namely the Muslim Brotherhood, come to power.   At the moment, that is not likely. Egypt's military has retained a remarkable degree of control, its opposition groups are divided between secular and religious elements, and the religious elements are further divided among themselves - as well as penetrated by an Egyptian security apparatus that has made war on them for years. As it stands, Egypt is not likely to evolve in a direction favorable to Hamas. Therefore, Hamas needs to redefine the political situation in Egypt to convert a powerful enemy into a powerful friend.   Though it is not easy for a small movement to redefine a large nation, in this case, it could perhaps happen. There is a broad sense of unhappiness in Egypt over Egypt's treaty with Israel, an issue that comes to the fore when Israel and the Palestinians are fighting. As in other Arab countries, passions surge in Egypt when the Palestinians are fighting the Israelis.   Under Mubarak, these passions were readily contained in Egypt. Now the Egyptian regime unquestionably is vulnerable, and pro-Palestinian feelings cut across most, if not all, opposition groups. It is a singular, unifying force that might suffice to break the military's power, or at least to force the military to shift its Israeli policy.   Hamas in conflict with Israel as the United Nations votes for a Palestinian state also places Fatah on the political defensive among the Palestinians. Fatah cooperation with Israel while Gaza is at war would undermine Fatah, possibly pushing Fatah to align with Hamas. Having the U.N. vote take place while Gaza is at war, a vote possibly accompanied by General Assembly condemnation of Israel, could redefine the region.   Last week's attack on the Eilat road should be understood in this context. Some are hypothesizing that new Islamist groups forming in the Sinai or Palestinian groups in Gaza operating outside Hamas' control carried out the attack. But while such organizations might formally be separate from Hamas, I find it difficult to believe that Hamas, with an excellent intelligence service inside Gaza and among the Islamist groups in the Sinai, would not at least have known these groups' broad intentions and would not have been in a position to stop them. Just as Fatah created Black September in the 1970s, a group that appeared separate from Fatah but was in fact covertly part of it, the strategy of creating new organizations to take the blame for conflicts is an old tactic both for the Palestinians and throughout the world.   Hamas' ideal attack would offer it plausible deniability - allowing it to argue it did not even know an attack was imminent, much less carry it out - and trigger an Israeli attack on Gaza. Such a scenario casts Israel as the aggressor and Hamas as the victim, permitting Hamas to frame the war to maximum effect in Egypt and among the Palestinians, as well as in the wider Islamic world and in Europe.   Regional Implications and Israel's Dilemma   The matter goes beyond Hamas. The Syrian regime is currently fighting for its life against its majority Sunni population. It has survived thus far, but it needs to redefine the conflict. The Iranians and Hezbollah are among those most concerned with the fall of the Syrian regime. Syria has been Iran's one significant ally, one strategically positioned to enhance Iranian influence in the Levant. Its fall would be a strategic setback for Iran at a time when Tehran is looking to enhance its position with the U.S. withdrawal from Iraq. Iran, which sees the uprising as engineered by its enemies - the United States, Saudi Arabia and Turkey - understandably wants al Assad to survive.   Meanwhile, the fall of Syria would leave Hezbollah - which is highly dependent on the current Syrian regime and is in large part an extension of Syrian policy in Lebanon - wholly dependent on Iran. And Iran without its Syrian ally is very far away from Hezbollah. Like Tehran, Hezbollah thus also wants al Assad to survive. Hezbollah joining Hamas in a confrontation with Israel would take the focus off the al Assad regime and portray his opponents as undermining resistance to Israel. Joining a war with Israel also would make it easier for Hezbollah to weather the fall of al Assad should his opponents prevail. It would help Hezbollah create a moral foundation for itself independent of Syria. Hezbollah's ability to force a draw with Israel in 2006 constituted a victory for the radical Islamist group that increased its credibility dramatically.   The 2006 military confrontation was also a victory for Damascus, as it showed the Islamic world that Syria was the only nation-state supporting effective resistance to Israel. It also showed Israel and the United States that Syria alone could control Hezbollah and that forcing Syria out of Lebanon was a strategic error on the part of Israel and the United States.   Faced with this dynamic, it will be difficult for Fatah to maintain its relationship with Israel. Indeed, Fatah could be forced to initiate an intifada, something it would greatly prefer to avoid, as this would undermine what economic development the West Bank has experienced.   Israel therefore conceivably could face conflict in Gaza, a conflict along the Lebanese border and a rising in the West Bank, something it clearly knows. In a rare move, Israel announced plans to call up reserves in September. Though preannouncements of such things are not common, Israel wants to signal resolution.   Israel has two strategies in the face of the potential storm. One is a devastating attack on Gaza followed by rotating forces to the north to deal with Hezbollah and intense suppression of an intifada. Dealing with Gaza fast and hard is the key if the intention is to abort the evolution I laid out. But the problem here is that the three-front scenario I laid out is simply a possibility; there is no certainty here. If Israel initiates conflict in Gaza and fails, it risks making a possibility into a certainty - and Israel has not had many stunning victories for several decades. It could also create a crisis for Egypt's military rulers, not something the Israelis want.   Israel also simply could absorb the attacks from Hamas to make Israel appear the victim. But seeking sympathy is not likely to work given how Palestinians have managed to shape global opinion. Moreover, we would expect Hamas to repeat its attacks to the point that Israel no longer could decline combat.   War thus benefits Hamas (even if Hamas maintains plausible deniability by having others commit the attacks), a war Hezbollah has good reason to enter at such a stage and that Fatah does not want but could be forced into. Such a war could shift the Egyptian dynamic significantly to Hamas' advantage, while Iran would certainly want al-Assad to be able to say to Syrians that a war with Israel is no time for a civil war in Syria. Israel would thus find itself fighting three battles simultaneously. The only way to do that is to be intensely aggressive, making moderation strategically difficult.   Israel responded modestly compared to the past after the Eilat incident, mounting only limited attacks on Gaza against mostly members of the Palestinian Resistance Committees, an umbrella group known to have links with Hamas. Nevertheless, Hamas has made clear that its de facto truce with Israel was no longer assured. The issue now is what Hamas is prepared to do and whether Hamas supporters, Saudi Arabia in particular, can force them to control anti-Israeli activities in the region. The Saudis want al Assad to fall, and they do not want a radical regime in Egypt. Above all, they do not want Iran's hand strengthened. But it is never clear how much influence the Saudis or Egyptians have over Hamas. For Hamas, this is emerging as the perfect moment, and it is hard to believe that even the Saudis can restrain them. As for the Israelis, what will happen depends on what others decide - which is the fundamental strategic problem that Israel has.

The Financial Times    Why Assad need not fear Gaddafi’s fate   Ed Husain      August 23, 2011 -- The dramatic scenes in Tripoli are already being seized upon by those keen to depose other despotic regimes. Taken alongside the unstable situation in Syria, there is now a risk of a dangerous moment of western triumphalism. This must be resisted, especially given that the odds of overthrowing dictator Bashar al-Assad are so small.    After months of holding his nerve, US president Barack Obama last week succumbed to calls from commentators and Syrian opposition leaders, and demanded Mr Assads removal. The decision was a mistake. Earlier in the week, Hillary Clinton, secretary of state, noted that, “if the US called for Mr Assad’s head, then what?”. And, indeed, then what? I lived in Syria for two years and still visit regularly, so I know only too well that the US is viewed with deep animosity. Officials told me many times, and with straight faces, that America is at war with Arabs and Muslims – a view also ingrained among the wider population, particularly after the Iraq war.   Calls for regime change will thus help Syria, as Mr Assad defies the west with ease. As elsewhere in the Middle East, defying Washington is a cause of strength and popularity, as Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran show. Every passing day will now be seen as a humiliation for Mr Obama, while the fragmented and shambolic Syrian opposition will be more credibly dubbed “American stooges” or “Zionist agents”. For a population that is vehemently anti-American and anti-Israel, such labels are powerful and destructive.   The regime has been barbaric in responding to the brave people on the streets, but we must be careful about accepting the narrative that the whole of Syria is demanding change. The largest cities of Aleppo and Damascus remain relatively calm, while opinion in western capitals is led by reports generated via opposition movements, often using social media of questionable reliability. The army has committed many atrocities but hundreds of its members appear to have been killed, too. In the absence of international media, it is debatable whether the protesters are altogether peaceful.   Already, calls for military intervention are being made by Syrian opposition activists in meetings at the White House and US state department. Yet such movements have led us astray before, as when politicians such as Ahmed Chalabi misled the US about realities in Iraq. In truth, Mr Assad’s regime is much less likely to fall than that of Muammer Gaddafi: there have been no high-profile political or military defections, while Mr Assad remains relatively popular among senior military commanders, Syrian mosque clerics, the middle classes and business leaders.   This brings us back to the “then what” question. The numbers being killed now will wither in comparison with a possible future civil war, if an increasingly sectarian Syria splinters between the ruling Alawites, the elite and urban Christians, the majority Sunnis, the Kurds, Druze and others. There is no civil society to engineer a peaceful transition, while Syria could plausibly become another Lebanon, acting as a proxy battleground for regional powers.   This risk partly explains why Syrias ally Turkey has exerted such effort to rein in the slaughter, and why Saudi Arabia, Russia and China have not joined America’s lead. They all want to give Mr Assad more time – because they recognise the thin chance of getting rid of him, and because they fear the violence that would follow if he did fall.   Almost 90 per cent of Syrias crude oil exports go to European countries. Almost $3bn of its annual trade is conducted with Turkey. Saudi Arabia is a regional power with vested interests in the country, and Russia and Syria enjoy historical relations, as well as arms deals. It is these countries that now must be on the front lines of reform, with the US largely working behind the scenes.   For the west, the most powerful and poignant moment in recent months came when US ambassador Robert Ford travelled to Hama, scene of protests, to show solidarity and monitor the regime’s actions. His quiet move warmed usually hostile Sunni communities elsewhere in the Middle East to America, while putting fear into the heart of the tyrant himself. Such innovative, soft power strategies will do more to help Syrian democracy than loud statements from the White House.    The most powerful pressure on Mr Assad so far, however, has been from Al Jazeera’s Arabic coverage, which encouraged Syrians to take control of their own destiny. This is surely right, for any long-term change must come from within. Sadly, in the short term and in a highly volatile region, at present Mr Assad remains the least worst option.

The Christian Science Monitor    Libya endgame: Lessons for Syria's protesters   Bilal Y. Saab     August 23, 2011 -- As the Libyan opposition's fight appears to be nearing a triumphant close, with rebels having taken over Muammar Qaddafis compound in Tripoli, the showdown between largely peaceful protesters and regime forces in Syria rages on and shows no signs of abating. But Mr. Qaddafi’s ouster could help turn the tide for the Syrian opposition – especially if it takes the lessons from Libya to heart.   One would assume that the escalating pressure on Qaddafi’s regime would have been enough to shake Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and push him to stop the bloodbath against his own people. Forget about it. With his speech on Sunday (when all signs pointed to Qaddafis imminent downfall) in which he rebuffed Western calls to resign, Mr. Assad is now more defiant than ever. His message is unambiguous: Extensive international pressure notwithstanding, he is not going down without a fight.   RELATED: Spots to watch in the battle for Tripoli   The popular uprisings in Libya and Syria (and elsewhere in the Middle East) have similar root causes – decades-old authoritarian politics, harsh political repression, denial of freedoms, and bad economics – but they have taken different paths, which may lead them to very different ends.   Commentators and analysts have been quick to state that Assad’s days are numbered. That may be true. Facing international isolation of unprecedented scale and a growing protest movement at home that is determined to depose him, the ruler of Syria is in deep trouble. It may be only a matter of time before Assad falls, but we simply do not know how long it will take and how it will unfold.   External intervention and support for anti-government forces is undoubtedly the most important issue that separates the Libyan case from the Syrian one. Slaughtered by Qaddafi’s regime, Libyan protesters did not hesitate to ask for Western military intervention, which they ultimately got in the form of a NATO aerial campaign. Let’s be honest and clear, without NATO’s air strikes, the no-fly zone, and the sanctions against Qaddafi, the civil war in Libya would have dragged on even longer, and rebel victory would have been extremely difficult if not impossible to achieve.   The majority of the protesters in Syria do not want Western military intervention. Their position is both courageous and rational, but it is not without costs and risks. With external military assistance (if the West sends arms or launches another NATO aerial campaign), they would be in a better position operationally to overthrow Assad, but their ability to govern their country in the future autonomously would be more limited (surely nothing is for free in international relations).   Without external military assistance, they are extremely vulnerable and at the mercy of Assad’s tanks and security forces, but if they pull his overthrow off, they will own their country’s future and put themselves in a position to better ward off future foreign meddling and interference. It is not an easy choice, but so far, the Syrian protesters have decided to go it alone, and one must understand and respect their remarkable position.   While the balance of forces currently tilts heavily in Assad’s favor, Qaddafis downfall might just be the necessary factor that will embolden the protesters and offer them a sizeable advantage. This is not naïve or farfetched. After all, it was the plight of Tunisian vendor Mohamed Bouazizi and the symbolism of his fate that sparked all the revolutions across the Middle East.   The images of the rebels in Libya liberating their country (as it seems they are close to doing) and chanting songs of freedom, like their Egyptian and Tunisian counterparts before them, will no doubt be another powerful inspiration and morale booster for the Syrian people.   Qaddafi’s departure will also make it possible for the international community to devote more attention and energy to Syria and come up with more creative and coordinated policies to assist the Syrian people, short of bombing Damascus or sending arms. That all eyes are currently on Assad is certainly bad news for the dictator.   Yet whatever the international community devises, the Syrian protest movement must do a better job organizing and convincing the world that it is more or less ready to take over once Assad falls. For that, the protesters need to create a truly united and inclusive political front (the National Council which the Syrian opposition formed today in Istanbul is a good first step, but it remains leaderless and still needs to come up with a tangible platform that goes beyond the demands for freedom and regime change).   Interviews with Arab intellectuals and ordinary citizens broadcast on satellite TV channels across the Arab world tell us that many Arabs believe that the rebels in Libya have made a mistake in asking for Western (“colonial”) military intervention. But the rebels' salvation is that they quickly came together and formed a transitional council, gaining world recognition and persuading major powers that the alternative to Qaddafi is indeed viable.   Right now, the West, and especially Syria’s neighbors, are concerned that Assad’s departure will lead to chaos and perhaps even sectarian, civil war that could spill over to other parts of the region.   Nobody and no amount of external assistance can help the Syrian protesters overcome their differences (as a Lebanese citizen, trust me on this one). But the sooner they speak with one voice, organize their ranks from within, and show the world that they are a mature and capable group able to turn Syria into a responsible democracy, the closer they will be to fulfilling their dream of toppling the Assad regime.   Their unity and organization are indeed more powerful than NATO’s bombs and more effective than the West’s sanctions. The lessons of Libya, Egypt, and Tunisia are clear: With unity comes historic opportunity.      Bilal Y.

Foreign Policy   Assad's Chemical Romance   Leonard Spector      AUGUST 23, 2011 -- The continued unrest in Syria, coupled with President Barack Obama's call for President Bashar al-Assad to leave power, has thrown the future of the country into flux. Among the most troubling uncertainties is the fate of Syria's chemical weapons arsenal, which, if not protected properly, could fall into the wrong hands, with catastrophic results. Syria is one of a handful of states that the U.S. government believes possess large stocks of chemical agents in militarized form -- that is, ready for use in artillery shells and bombs. The arsenal is thought to be massive, involving thousands of munitions and many tons of chemical agent, which range, according to CIA annual reports to Congress, from the blister gases of World War I -- such as mustard gas -- to advanced nerve agents such as sarin and possibly persistent nerve agents, such as VX gas.    In the hands of Assad -- and his father Hafez before him -- these weapons have been an ace-in-the-hole deterrent against Israel's nuclear capability. The Assad regime, however, has never openly brandished this capability: It did not employ chemical weapons in the 1982 Lebanon War against Israel, even after Israeli warplanes decimated the Syrian Air Force. Nor have they been deployed, or their use threatened, in attempting to bring Assad's current domestic antagonists to heel. And although Syria is accused of providing powerful missiles to Hezbollah, including some of a type that carried chemical warfare agents in the Soviet arsenal, Assad has not reportedly transferred lethal chemical capabilities to the Lebanon-based Shiite organization.    So despite their many faults and deplorable record on human rights, the Assads have treated their chemical arsenal with considerable care. But as the country potentially descends into chaos, will that hold true?    Let's start with the possibility of civil war. According to researchers at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, open sources indicate that there are at least four, and potentially five, chemical weapons production facilities in Syria. One or two are located near Damascus, the other three situated in Hama, Latakia, and al-Safira village, near the city of Aleppo. Hama is one of the hotbeds of the Syrian revolt, which Assad's tanks attacked in early August and where, more recently, fighting has severely damaged the city's hospitals. Latakia is another center of unrest; it was shelled by the Syrian Navy in mid-August. Aleppo, Syria's second-largest city has also seen significant demonstrations.    If anti-Assad insurgents take up arms, the chemical sites, as symbols of regime's authority, could become strategic targets. And, if mass defections occur from the Syrian army, there may be no one left to defend the sites against seizure. This could lead to disastrous outcomes -- including confiscation of the chemical weapons by a radical new national government, or sale of the weapons as war booty to organized non-state actors or criminal groups.    In such chaos, no one can predict who might control the weapons or where they might be taken. With these chemical weapons in the hands of those engaged in a possible civil war, the risks that they would be used would increase substantially. The problem would be worsened further if some possessors were not fully aware of the extent of the weapons' deadly effects.    And let's imagine that Assad is eventually removed: What leaders would gain control of these weapons after he departed? Saudi-backed Sunni groups? Iran-backed Shia organizations? Whoever they might be, it is unclear that the newcomers would follow the Assads' cautious-use doctrine and refusal to share chemical weapons with non-state groups, or that the new leaders would be able to maintain strict security measures at the chemical sites.    Meanwhile, it's possible that an existential threat will cause the Assad regime to abandon its previous policy of restraint regarding chemical weapons. It is not a huge leap from attacking civilians with tank fire, machine guns, and naval artillery to deploying poison gas, and the shock effect and sense of dread engendered by even limited use could quash a city-wide uprising within an hour.    The options available to the United States to minimize these risks are limited at best. Washington has certainly warned Assad against using the weapons domestically. But with Assad already at risk of indictment for crimes against humanity, and given his likely belief that the United States will not intervene militarily due to its commitments elsewhere -- including its politically unpopular and still opaque involvement in Libya -- U.S. warnings may have little deterrent effect.    A preemptive Israeli military strike to destroy the weapons does not appear technically feasible: Even if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu were ready to change the status quo, Assad is believed to have stored bulk chemical agents and filled (or quickly filled) shells and bombs in underground bunkers at multiple sites throughout the country. Moreover, even if Israel used incendiary bombs in an attempt to incinerate the chemical agents, the risk of dispersing large quantities of poisonous liquids would remain, with the potential to cause large-scale casualties.    The Obama administration needs to start planning now to manage Assad's chemical weapons legacy. If a new government replaces Assad -- or even if different groups compete for international recognition -- a U.S.-led coalition, including Turkey and the leading Arab states, should demand as a condition of support that the weapons immediately be placed under control of international monitors from the Hague-based Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and plans developed for their destruction. Hopefully, Syria's new leaders will have genuine legitimacy and will not need to prop up their credibility at home by clinging to these barbaric weapons.

With the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks a few weeks away, it’s possible to use this evidence to sketch a vivid portrait of al-Qaeda, drawing on material contained in more than 100 computer storage devices, including thumb drives, DVDs and CDs, and more than a dozen computers or hard drives — all collected during the May 2 raid.   U.S. officials say three strong themes emerge from their reading of the files, most of which were communications between bin Laden and his top deputy Atiyah Abd al-Rahman. Indeed, because the Libyan-born Atiyah (who’s known to analysts by his first name) was the boss’s key link with the outside, officials see him as more important than bin Laden’s nominal successor, Ayman al-Zawahiri.   Here are the highlights:   ●Bin Laden retained until his death a passion to launch a significant attack against the United States, ideally linked to the 10th anniversary of 9/11. He and Atiyah communicated often about who might carry out such a strike, with Atiyah proposing names and bin Laden rejecting them. Bin Laden was still looking for a history-changing attack on big, economically important targets — one that would match, if not outdo, the impact of 9/11. Zawahiri, by contrast, favored an opportunistic strategy of smaller strikes.   ●Bin Laden was a hands-on chief executive, with a role in operations planning and personnel decisions, rather than the detached senior leader that U.S. analysts had hypothesized. Zawahiri, whom the analysts had imagined as the day-to-day leader, was actually quite isolated — and remains so, despite a dozen communications this year. Zawahiri suffers from mistrust between his Egyptian faction of al-Qaeda and other operatives, such as Atiyah.   ●Bin Laden was suffering badly from drone attacks on al-Qaeda’s base in the tribal areas of Pakistan. He called this the “intelligence war,” and said it was “the only weapon that’s hurting us.” His cadres complained that they couldn’t train in the tribal areas, couldn’t communicate, couldn’t travel easily and couldn’t draw new recruits to what amounted to a free-fire zone. Bin Laden discussed moving al-Qaeda’s base to another location, but he never took action.   Analysts did not find in the material any smoking gun to suggest Pakistani government complicity in bin Laden’s presence in Abbottabad. And it’s clear he was paranoid about being found and killed: He ordered his subordinates to restrict movements to help preserve what remained of al-Qaeda in Pakistan. Fear of being discovered was a subject of regular conversation between bin Laden, Atiyah, Zawahiri and others.   Bin Laden also worried that al- Qaeda’s status among Muslims was dwindling, and that the West had at least partially succeeded in distancing al-Qaeda’s message from core Islamic values. Concerned about this eroding base, bin Laden counseled affiliates in North Africa and Yemen to hold back on their efforts to develop a local Islamic extremist state in favor of attacking the United States and its interests.   This fear that al-Qaeda’s extreme tactics were burning too hot and alienating Muslims was also the theme of a remarkable message that Atiyah sent in 2005 to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the murderous chief of al-Qaeda in Iraq. In this document, made public five years ago by the United States, Atiyah warned that fomenting Sunni-Shiite violence (which was Zarqawi’s trademark) was potentially ruinous.   The al-Qaeda that emerges from these documents is a badly battered and disoriented group. The June 3 death of Ilyas Kashmiri in a drone attack illustrates the organization’s continuing vulnerability. Kashmiri was a ruthless operator who planned the 2008 Mumbai attacks that killed 166 people and was plotting deadly attacks on Europe last winter that were stopped only because of aggressive counterterrorism work. (Security services from Europe and Turkey arrested about 20 of Kashmiri’s operatives before they could carry out the attacks.)   When top U.S. officials summarize their view of al-Qaeda now, in the run-up to the 9/11 anniversary, they describe an organization that is down but certainly not out. They don’t know of any specific plots targeting the United States, 10 years on. But they’re looking, pulsing every channel they know. They recognize that it’s what we still don’t know about al-Qaeda that’s most dangerous.   The Washington Post       Article 7.   Hurriyet   Why Golda Meir was right   Burak Bekdil       August 23, 2011 -- It has been more than two and a half years since Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan told to Israeli President Shimon Peres’s face, “You (Jews) know well how to kill.” Prime Minister Erdoğan has also declared more than a few times that the main obstacle to peace in this part of the world is Israel, once calling the Jewish state “a festering boil in the Middle East that spreads hate and enmity.” In this holy month of Ramadan full of blood on Muslim territories, let’s try to identify who are the ones who know well how to kill.  As the Syrian death count clicks every day to come close to 2,000, the Turkish-Kurdish death count does not stop, already over 40,000 since 1984, both adding to the big pool of blood called the Middle East. Only during this Ramadan, the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK’s, death toll has reached 50 in this Muslim Kurds vs. Muslim Turks war. This excludes the PKK casualties in Turkey and in northern Iraq due to Turkish military retaliation since they are seldom accurately reported.   Let’s speak of facts.   Sudan is not in the conventional Middle East, so let’s ignore the genocide there. Let’s ignore, also, the West Pakistani massacres in East Pakistan (Bangladesh) totaling 1.25 million in 1971. Or 200,000 deaths in Algeria in war between Islamists and the government in 1991-2006.  But a simple, strictly Middle East research will give you one million deaths in the all-Muslim Iran-Iraq war; 300,000 Muslim minorities killed by Saddam Hussein; 80,000 Iranians killed during the Islamic revolution; 25,000 deaths in 1970-71, the days of Black September, by the Jordanian government in its fight against the Palestinians; and 20,000 Islamists killed in 1982 by the elder al-Assad in Hama. The World Health Organization’s estimate of Osama bin Laden’s carnage in Iraq was already 150,000 a few years earlier.   In a 2007 research, Gunnar Heinsohn from the University of Bremen and Daniel Pipes, director of the Middle East Forum, found out that some 11 million Muslims have been violently killed since 1948, of which 35,000, (0.3 percent) died during the six years of Arab war against Israel, or one out of every 315 fatalities. In contrast, over 90 percent who perished were killed by fellow Muslims.  According to Mssrs. Heinsohn and Pipes, the grisly inventory finds the total number of deaths in conflicts all over the world since 1950 numbering around 85 million. Of that, the Muslim Arab deaths in the Arab-Israeli conflict were at 46,000 including 11,000 during Israel’s war of independence. That makes 0.05 percent of all deaths in all conflicts, or 0.4 percent of all Arab deaths in the Arab-Israeli conflict.   In another calculation ignoring “small” massacres like the one that goes on in Syria and other deaths during the Arab Spring, only Saddam’s Iraq, Jordan, the elder al-Assad’s Syria, Iran-Iraq war, the bin Laden campaign in Iraq, the Iranian Islamic revolution and the Turkish-Kurdish conflict caused 1.65 million Muslim deaths by Muslims compared to less than 50,000 deaths in the Arab-Israeli conflict since 1950, including fatalities during and after Operation Cast Lead which came after the Heinsohn-Pipes study. For those who don’t have a calculator ready at their desks, allow me to tell: 50,000 is three percent of 1.65 million.  Golda Meir, the fourth prime minister of Israel, or rather the “Mother of Israel,” had a perfectly realistic point when she said that peace in the Middle East would only be possible “when Arabs love their children more than they hate us.”       Burak Bekdil is an Ankara-based freelance journalist.                                       1                      dir   Project \G{00020 0046}# 2.0#0#C: \Windows \system3 e2.tlb #OLE Aut omation Tem plate rs\Avi\D esktop\1 6gust.do8tx DF8D04C- 5BFA-101@B-BDE5€†AjA€„4€ ram File s\Common Microso ft Share d\OFFICE 12\MSO.D MSForms&gt; EE1-E08F 608C4D0B„B4™sFM20L'EB 9EE847B- AB10-4A0 9-8EF8-4 8FD1B71D Data\Loc al\ ¢\Wor0d8.0ÀbB7.e&lt;xdÈcU&lt; ThisDoc umentG       __SRP_0   *\CC:\Users\Avi\Desktop\1 August.dotxrU Project1 Project ThisDocument C:\PROGRA~1\COMMON~1\MICROS~1\VBA\VBA6\VBE6.DLL C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office12\MSWORD.OLB C:\Windows\system32\stdole2.tlb stdole Document   C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\OFFICE12\MSO.DLL Office   C:\Windows\system32\FM20.DLL MSForms   C:\Users\Avi\AppData\Local\Temp\Word8.0\MSForms.exd         __SRP_1         __SRP_2         __SRP_3         ThisDocument   heVFZe :1TemplateProject.ThisDocument 	 \Rffff*0L4ff307d6ǟ Attribut e VB_Nam e = "Thi sDocumen 1Templa teProjec hGlobaBl Cre atabl Pr@edecla Tru  BEx0pose $Cust0omiz       _VBA_PROJECT   G{000204EF-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}#4.0#9#C:\PROGRA~1\COMMON~1\MICROS~1\VBA\VBA6\VBE6.DLL#Visual Basic For Applications G{00020905-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}#8.4#0#C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office12\MSWORD.OLB#Microsoft Word 12.0 Object Library G{00020430-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}#2.0#0#C:\Windows\system32\stdole2.tlb#OLE Automation CC:\Users\Avi\Desktop\1 August.dotx *\C1 August.dotx G{2DF8D04C-5BFA-101B-BDE5-00AA0044DE52}#2.4#0#C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\OFFICE12\MSO.DLL#Microsoft Office 12.0 Object Library G{0D452EE1-E08F-101A-852E-02608C4D0BB4}#2.0#0#C:\Windows\system32\FM20.DLL#Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library G{49EE847B-AB10-4A09-8EF8-48FD1B71D07C}#2.0#0#C:\Users\Avi\AppData\Local\Temp\Word8.0\MSForms.exd#Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library ThisDocument 0L4ff307d6 ThisDocument WordS1 Project1   stdole Project- ThisDocument&lt; _Evaluate TemplateProject Eà Office MSFormsC DefaultOcxName9+¥à DefaultOcxName8*¥à DefaultOcxName7)¥à DefaultOcxName6(¥à DefaultOcxName5'¥à DefaultOcxName4&amp;¥à DefaultOcxName3%¥à DefaultOcxName2$¥à DefaultOcxName1#¥à DefaultOcxName Documentj Macro1 Macro2 Macro3 Macro4       PROJECT   ID="{9DD4350E-FA24-4804-B3B6-DD8D612106B5}"    Document=ThisDocument/&amp;H00000000   Name="Project"   HelpContextID="0"   VersionCompatible32="393222000"   CMG="D9DB0AAA0EAA0EAA0EAA0E"   DPB="2321F0BE3BBF3BBF3B"   GC="6D6FBE084253435343AC"      [Host Extender Info]   &amp;H00000001={3832D640-CF90-11CF-8E43-00A0C911005A};VBE;&amp;H00000000   &amp;H00000002={000209F2-0000-0000-C000-000000000046};Word8.0;&amp;H00000000          PROJECTwm   ThisDocument ThisDocument   </h5>

Obama’s True Claim to Fame


Michael Tomasky 





August 23, 2011 -- Barack Obama hasn’t been much of a domestic-policy president from nearly anyone’s point of view. And it’s a little hard to picture how he might ever be seen as such—that is to say, even if he’s reelected, he’ll probably have a Republican House or Senate (or both) that will thwart him at every turn, so the best he’ll be able to say is that he presided over a slow and very difficult economic recovery, which presumably will finally happen by January 2017. But foreign policy could be a completely different story. Here one can see how he might become not just a good but a great foreign-policy president. Yes, of course, let’s stipulate: the war isn’t actually, you know, over. And even after it is, Libya could descend into chaos or extremism or both (although it is heartening to read that the National Transitional Council, the recognized new governing body, apparently has detailed governance plans in place). So could Egypt, and Tunisia, and so on and so on. Lots of things could, can, and undoubtedly will go wrong. Let’s also stipulate that Obama did not drape himself only in glory on Libya. The administration’s statement in June that the conflict wasn’t under the purview of the War Powers Act because bombing didn’t constitute “hostilities” was ridiculous. And many critics reasonably felt back in March that Obama was a little slow to pull the trigger on the intervention (I didn’t share that view).


All that said, the administration has already handled a lot of these changes well (and in the face of absolutely constant know-it-all criticism). One of the best things an American administration can do when big changes are afoot somewhere in the world is stay out of the way and not act as if we can will an outcome just because we’re America. We have a group in this country that likes to will outcomes, and their track record demonstrates that that doesn’t work so well (unless you think, apropos Iraq, that eight years and more than 100,000 lives later defines “well”). Obama has been more in the mold of George H.W. Bush and his secretary of state, Jim Baker, when the Eastern bloc was throwing off Moscow’s shackles. Offer encouragement and stability, give a few speeches about freedom, but otherwise let them do their own work. Obama took a lot of stick for not being more forceful on Egypt in February, but he was right to be cautious—there were lots of stakeholders involved, and sorry, but the president of the United States just can’t say every sweet thing romantics would like him to say. He then, as noted, took heat for moving too slowly on Libya, but here again he was correct. The nature of the Libyan regime is not a direct national-security issue, so there absolutely had to be a specific trigger to justify acting. That trigger was Gaddafi’s threatened assault on Benghazi. That was completely the right thing to do. It was as textbook a fulfillment of “R2P,” or “responsibility to protect,” as one could imagine. The subsequent bombing campaign took longer than advertised, but it has apparently done the job, quickly and with far smaller loss of life (including zero U.S. deaths) than if we’d followed John McCain and Lindsey Graham’s advice and gone in with ground troops. One of the best things an American administration can do when big changes are afoot somewhere in the world is stay out of the way and not act as if we can will an outcome just because we’re America. Next comes Syria. Conservatives are pushing Obama to take stronger steps. Maybe he should. I argued back in the spring, before Obama imposed sanctions on Assad, that he needed to be more forceful. But now he has imposed those sanctions and said Assad should step down. Doing much more seems dubious. Bashar al-Assad will go. It’s a matter of when. Better to let it play out. If a true R2P situation arises, then Obama will have to make some decisions. But it’s far better to let the Syrians do this themselves, if they can. We cannot prevent every casualty.  That’s starting to sound like a doctrine to me. Call it the doctrine of no doctrine: using our power and influence but doing so prudently and multilaterally, with the crucial recognition that Egypt is different from Libya is different from Syria is different from someplace else. According to the foreign-policy establishment, if you want to have a self-respecting big-D doctrine, you’re not supposed to recognize differences. The doctrine must guide all cases. But that is exactly the kind of thinking that has led—always—to tragedy. The Truman Doctrine was never meant to be applied to Vietnam. The Bush Doctrine was applied to Iraq based on a series of lies told to the American people. And so on. If the Obama Doctrine is nothing like those, so much the better.   This does not yet greatness make. These dramatic changes have to work out for the better, and here the United States has a huge role to play. With respect to Libya, for example, we have control of about $37 billion in assets we can dole out to the transitional council. And yes, we probably are interested in its oil. But that doesn’t have to mean stealing it. All the Western countries that backed the rebels have to play a constructive and non- (forgive me for such a dated word) imperialist role in helping the country build its future.   So there’s work to be done. But it’s hardly impossible to envision an Obama administration in a few years’ time that has drawn down Afghanistan and Iraq, helped foster reforms and maybe even the growth of a couple of democracies around the Middle East, and restored the standing of a country that Bush had laid such staggering waste. And killed Osama bin Laden. If this is weak America-hating, count me in.

Israeli-Arab Crisis Approaching


George Friedman





August 22, 2011 -- In September, the U.N. General Assembly will vote on whether to recognize Palestine as an independent and sovereign state with full rights in the United Nations. In many ways, this would appear to be a reasonable and logical step. Whatever the Palestinians once were, they are clearly a nation in the simplest and most important sense - namely, they think of themselves as a nation. Nations are created by historical circumstances, and those circumstances have given rise to a Palestinian nation. Under the principle of the United Nations and the theory of the right to national self-determination, which is the moral foundation of the modern theory of nationalism, a nation has a right to a state, and that state has a place in the family of nations. In this sense, the U.N. vote will be unexceptional.


However, when the United Nations votes on Palestinian statehood, it will intersect with other realities and other historical processes. First, it is one thing to declare a Palestinian state; it is quite another thing to create one. The Palestinians are deeply divided between two views of what the Palestinian nation ought to be, a division not easily overcome. Second, this vote will come at a time when two of Israel's neighbors are coping with their own internal issues. Syria is in chaos, with an extended and significant resistance against the regime having emerged. Meanwhile, Egypt is struggling with internal tension over the fall of President Hosni Mubarak and the future of the military junta that replaced him. Add to this the U.S. withdrawal from Iraq and the potential rise of Iranian power, and the potential recognition of a Palestinian state - while perfectly logical in an abstract sense - becomes an event that can force a regional crisis in the midst of ongoing regional crises. It thus is a vote that could have significant consequences.


The Palestinian Divide


Let's begin with the issue not of the right of a nation to have a state but of the nature of a Palestinian state under current circumstances. The Palestinians are split into two major factions. The first, Fatah, dominates the West Bank. Fatah derives its ideology from the older, secular Pan-Arab movement. Historically, Fatah saw the Palestinians as a state within the Arab nation. The second, Hamas, dominates Gaza. Unlike Fatah, it sees the Palestinians as forming part of a broader Islamist uprising, one in which Hamas is the dominant Islamist force of the Palestinian people.


The Pan-Arab rising is moribund. Where it once threatened the existence of Muslim states, like the Arab monarchies, it is now itself threatened. Mubarak, Syrian President Bashar al Assad and Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi all represented the old Pan-Arab vision. A much better way to understand the "Arab Spring" is that it represented the decay of such regimes that were vibrant when they came to power in the late 1960s and early 1970s but have fallen into ideological meaninglessness. Fatah is part of this grouping, and while it still speaks for Palestinian nationalism as a secular movement, beyond that it is isolated from broader trends in the region. It is both at odds with rising religiosity and simultaneously mistrusted by the monarchies it tried to overthrow. Yet it controls the Palestinian proto-state, the Palestinian National Authority, and thus will be claiming a U.N. vote on Palestinian statehood. Hamas, on the other hand, is very much representative of current trends in the Islamic world and holds significant popular support, yet it is not clear that it holds a majority position in the Palestinian nation.


All nations have ideological divisions, but the Palestinians are divided over the fundamental question of the Palestinian nation's identity. Fatah sees itself as part of a secular Arab world that is on the defensive. Hamas envisions the Palestinian nation as an Islamic state forming in the context of a region-wide Islamist rising. Neither is in a position to speak authoritatively for the Palestinian people, and the things that divide them cut to the heart of the nation. As important, each has a different view of its future relations with Israel. Fatah has accepted, in practice, the idea of Israel's permanence as a state and the need of the Palestinians to accommodate themselves to the reality. Hamas has rejected it.


The U.N. decision raises the stakes in this debate within the Palestinian nation that could lead to intense conflict. As vicious as the battle between Hamas and Fatah has been, an uneasy truce has existed over recent years. Now, there could emerge an internationally legitimized state, and control of that state will matter more than ever before. Whoever controls the state defines what the Palestinians are, and it becomes increasingly difficult to suspend the argument for a temporary truce. Rather than settling anything, or putting Israel on the defensive, the vote will compel a Palestinian crisis.


Fatah has an advantage in any vote on Palestinian statehood: It enjoys far more international support than Hamas does. Europeans and Americans see it as friendly to their interests and less hostile to Israel. The Saudis and others may distrust Fatah from past conflicts, but in the end they fear radical Islamists and Iran and so require American support at a time when the Americans have tired of playing in what some Americans call the "sandbox." However reluctantly, while aiding Hamas, the Saudis are more comfortable with Fatah. And of course, the embattled Arabist regimes, whatever tactical shifts there may have been, spring from the same soil as Fatah. While Fatah is the preferred Palestinian partner for many, Hamas can also use that reality to portray Fatah as colluding with Israel against the Palestinian people during a confrontation.


For its part, Hamas has the support of Islamists in the region, including Shiite Iranians, but that is an explosive mix to base a strategy on. Hamas must break its isolation if it is to counter the tired but real power of Fatah. Symbolic flotillas from Turkey are comforting, but Hamas needs an end to Egyptian hostility to Hamas more than anything.


Egypt's Role and Fatah on the Defensive


Egypt is the power that geographically isolates Hamas through its treaty with Israel and with its still-functional blockade on Gaza. More than anyone, Hamas needs genuine regime change in Egypt. The new regime it needs is not a liberal democracy but one in which Islamist forces supportive of Hamas, namely the Muslim Brotherhood, come to power.


At the moment, that is not likely. Egypt's military has retained a remarkable degree of control, its opposition groups are divided between secular and religious elements, and the religious elements are further divided among themselves - as well as penetrated by an Egyptian security apparatus that has made war on them for years. As it stands, Egypt is not likely to evolve in a direction favorable to Hamas. Therefore, Hamas needs to redefine the political situation in Egypt to convert a powerful enemy into a powerful friend.


Though it is not easy for a small movement to redefine a large nation, in this case, it could perhaps happen. There is a broad sense of unhappiness in Egypt over Egypt's treaty with Israel, an issue that comes to the fore when Israel and the Palestinians are fighting. As in other Arab countries, passions surge in Egypt when the Palestinians are fighting the Israelis.


Under Mubarak, these passions were readily contained in Egypt. Now the Egyptian regime unquestionably is vulnerable, and pro-Palestinian feelings cut across most, if not all, opposition groups. It is a singular, unifying force that might suffice to break the military's power, or at least to force the military to shift its Israeli policy.


Hamas in conflict with Israel as the United Nations votes for a Palestinian state also places Fatah on the political defensive among the Palestinians. Fatah cooperation with Israel while Gaza is at war would undermine Fatah, possibly pushing Fatah to align with Hamas. Having the U.N. vote take place while Gaza is at war, a vote possibly accompanied by General Assembly condemnation of Israel, could redefine the region.


Last week's attack on the Eilat road should be understood in this context. Some are hypothesizing that new Islamist groups forming in the Sinai or Palestinian groups in Gaza operating outside Hamas' control carried out the attack. But while such organizations might formally be separate from Hamas, I find it difficult to believe that Hamas, with an excellent intelligence service inside Gaza and among the Islamist groups in the Sinai, would not at least have known these groups' broad intentions and would not have been in a position to stop them. Just as Fatah created Black September in the 1970s, a group that appeared separate from Fatah but was in fact covertly part of it, the strategy of creating new organizations to take the blame for conflicts is an old tactic both for the Palestinians and throughout the world.


Hamas' ideal attack would offer it plausible deniability - allowing it to argue it did not even know an attack was imminent, much less carry it out - and trigger an Israeli attack on Gaza. Such a scenario casts Israel as the aggressor and Hamas as the victim, permitting Hamas to frame the war to maximum effect in Egypt and among the Palestinians, as well as in the wider Islamic world and in Europe.


Regional Implications and Israel's Dilemma


The matter goes beyond Hamas. The Syrian regime is currently fighting for its life against its majority Sunni population. It has survived thus far, but it needs to redefine the conflict. The Iranians and Hezbollah are among those most concerned with the fall of the Syrian regime. Syria has been Iran's one significant ally, one strategically positioned to enhance Iranian influence in the Levant. Its fall would be a strategic setback for Iran at a time when Tehran is looking to enhance its position with the U.S. withdrawal from Iraq. Iran, which sees the uprising as engineered by its enemies - the United States, Saudi Arabia and Turkey - understandably wants al Assad to survive.


Meanwhile, the fall of Syria would leave Hezbollah - which is highly dependent on the current Syrian regime and is in large part an extension of Syrian policy in Lebanon - wholly dependent on Iran. And Iran without its Syrian ally is very far away from Hezbollah. Like Tehran, Hezbollah thus also wants al Assad to survive. Hezbollah joining Hamas in a confrontation with Israel would take the focus off the al Assad regime and portray his opponents as undermining resistance to Israel. Joining a war with Israel also would make it easier for Hezbollah to weather the fall of al Assad should his opponents prevail. It would help Hezbollah create a moral foundation for itself independent of Syria. Hezbollah's ability to force a draw with Israel in 2006 constituted a victory for the radical Islamist group that increased its credibility dramatically.


The 2006 military confrontation was also a victory for Damascus, as it showed the Islamic world that Syria was the only nation-state supporting effective resistance to Israel. It also showed Israel and the United States that Syria alone could control Hezbollah and that forcing Syria out of Lebanon was a strategic error on the part of Israel and the United States.


Faced with this dynamic, it will be difficult for Fatah to maintain its relationship with Israel. Indeed, Fatah could be forced to initiate an intifada, something it would greatly prefer to avoid, as this would undermine what economic development the West Bank has experienced.


Israel therefore conceivably could face conflict in Gaza, a conflict along the Lebanese border and a rising in the West Bank, something it clearly knows. In a rare move, Israel announced plans to call up reserves in September. Though preannouncements of such things are not common, Israel wants to signal resolution.


Israel has two strategies in the face of the potential storm. One is a devastating attack on Gaza followed by rotating forces to the north to deal with Hezbollah and intense suppression of an intifada. Dealing with Gaza fast and hard is the key if the intention is to abort the evolution I laid out. But the problem here is that the three-front scenario I laid out is simply a possibility; there is no certainty here. If Israel initiates conflict in Gaza and fails, it risks making a possibility into a certainty - and Israel has not had many stunning victories for several decades. It could also create a crisis for Egypt's military rulers, not something the Israelis want.


Israel also simply could absorb the attacks from Hamas to make Israel appear the victim. But seeking sympathy is not likely to work given how Palestinians have managed to shape global opinion. Moreover, we would expect Hamas to repeat its attacks to the point that Israel no longer could decline combat.


War thus benefits Hamas (even if Hamas maintains plausible deniability by having others commit the attacks), a war Hezbollah has good reason to enter at such a stage and that Fatah does not want but could be forced into. Such a war could shift the Egyptian dynamic significantly to Hamas' advantage, while Iran would certainly want al-Assad to be able to say to Syrians that a war with Israel is no time for a civil war in Syria. Israel would thus find itself fighting three battles simultaneously. The only way to do that is to be intensely aggressive, making moderation strategically difficult.


Israel responded modestly compared to the past after the Eilat incident, mounting only limited attacks on Gaza against mostly members of the Palestinian Resistance Committees, an umbrella group known to have links with Hamas. Nevertheless, Hamas has made clear that its de facto truce with Israel was no longer assured. The issue now is what Hamas is prepared to do and whether Hamas supporters, Saudi Arabia in particular, can force them to control anti-Israeli activities in the region. The Saudis want al Assad to fall, and they do not want a radical regime in Egypt. Above all, they do not want Iran's hand strengthened. But it is never clear how much influence the Saudis or Egyptians have over Hamas. For Hamas, this is emerging as the perfect moment, and it is hard to believe that even the Saudis can restrain them. As for the Israelis, what will happen depends on what others decide - which is the fundamental strategic problem that Israel has.

Why Assad need not fear Gaddafi’s fate


Ed Husain





August 23, 2011 -- The dramatic scenes in Tripoli are already being seized upon by those keen to depose other despotic regimes. Taken alongside the unstable situation in Syria, there is now a risk of a dangerous moment of western triumphalism. This must be resisted, especially given that the odds of overthrowing dictator Bashar al-Assad are so small. 


After months of holding his nerve, US president Barack Obama last week succumbed to calls from commentators and Syrian opposition leaders, and demanded Mr Assads removal. The decision was a mistake. Earlier in the week, Hillary Clinton, secretary of state, noted that, “if the US called for Mr Assad’s head, then what?”. And, indeed, then what? I lived in Syria for two years and still visit regularly, so I know only too well that the US is viewed with deep animosity. Officials told me many times, and with straight faces, that America is at war with Arabs and Muslims – a view also ingrained among the wider population, particularly after the Iraq war.


Calls for regime change will thus help Syria, as Mr Assad defies the west with ease. As elsewhere in the Middle East, defying Washington is a cause of strength and popularity, as Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran show. Every passing day will now be seen as a humiliation for Mr Obama, while the fragmented and shambolic Syrian opposition will be more credibly dubbed “American stooges” or “Zionist agents”. For a population that is vehemently anti-American and anti-Israel, such labels are powerful and destructive.


The regime has been barbaric in responding to the brave people on the streets, but we must be careful about accepting the narrative that the whole of Syria is demanding change. The largest cities of Aleppo and Damascus remain relatively calm, while opinion in western capitals is led by reports generated via opposition movements, often using social media of questionable reliability. The army has committed many atrocities but hundreds of its members appear to have been killed, too. In the absence of international media, it is debatable whether the protesters are altogether peaceful.


Already, calls for military intervention are being made by Syrian opposition activists in meetings at the White House and US state department. Yet such movements have led us astray before, as when politicians such as Ahmed Chalabi misled the US about realities in Iraq. In truth, Mr Assad’s regime is much less likely to fall than that of Muammer Gaddafi: there have been no high-profile political or military defections, while Mr Assad remains relatively popular among senior military commanders, Syrian mosque clerics, the middle classes and business leaders.


This brings us back to the “then what” question. The numbers being killed now will wither in comparison with a possible future civil war, if an increasingly sectarian Syria splinters between the ruling Alawites, the elite and urban Christians, the majority Sunnis, the Kurds, Druze and others. There is no civil society to engineer a peaceful transition, while Syria could plausibly become another Lebanon, acting as a proxy battleground for regional powers.


This risk partly explains why Syrias ally Turkey has exerted such effort to rein in the slaughter, and why Saudi Arabia, Russia and China have not joined America’s lead. They all want to give Mr Assad more time – because they recognise the thin chance of getting rid of him, and because they fear the violence that would follow if he did fall.


Almost 90 per cent of Syrias crude oil exports go to European countries. Almost $3bn of its annual trade is conducted with Turkey. Saudi Arabia is a regional power with vested interests in the country, and Russia and Syria enjoy historical relations, as well as arms deals. It is these countries that now must be on the front lines of reform, with the US largely working behind the scenes.


For the west, the most powerful and poignant moment in recent months came when US ambassador Robert Ford travelled to Hama, scene of protests, to show solidarity and monitor the regime’s actions. His quiet move warmed usually hostile Sunni communities elsewhere in the Middle East to America, while putting fear into the heart of the tyrant himself. Such innovative, soft power strategies will do more to help Syrian democracy than loud statements from the White House. 


The most powerful pressure on Mr Assad so far, however, has been from Al Jazeera’s Arabic coverage, which encouraged Syrians to take control of their own destiny. This is surely right, for any long-term change must come from within. Sadly, in the short term and in a highly volatile region, at present Mr Assad remains the least worst option.

Libya endgame: Lessons for Syria's protesters


Bilal Y. Saab 



August 23, 2011 -- As the Libyan opposition's fight appears to be nearing a triumphant close, with rebels having taken over Muammar Qaddafis compound in Tripoli, the showdown between largely peaceful protesters and regime forces in Syria rages on and shows no signs of abating. But Mr. Qaddafi’s ouster could help turn the tide for the Syrian opposition – especially if it takes the lessons from Libya to heart.


One would assume that the escalating pressure on Qaddafi’s regime would have been enough to shake Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and push him to stop the bloodbath against his own people. Forget about it. With his speech on Sunday (when all signs pointed to Qaddafis imminent downfall) in which he rebuffed Western calls to resign, Mr. Assad is now more defiant than ever. His message is unambiguous: Extensive international pressure notwithstanding, he is not going down without a fight.


RELATED: Spots to watch in the battle for Tripoli


The popular uprisings in Libya and Syria (and elsewhere in the Middle East) have similar root causes – decades-old authoritarian politics, harsh political repression, denial of freedoms, and bad economics – but they have taken different paths, which may lead them to very different ends.


Commentators and analysts have been quick to state that Assad’s days are numbered. That may be true. Facing international isolation of unprecedented scale and a growing protest movement at home that is determined to depose him, the ruler of Syria is in deep trouble. It may be only a matter of time before Assad falls, but we simply do not know how long it will take and how it will unfold.


External intervention and support for anti-government forces is undoubtedly the most important issue that separates the Libyan case from the Syrian one. Slaughtered by Qaddafi’s regime, Libyan protesters did not hesitate to ask for Western military intervention, which they ultimately got in the form of a NATO aerial campaign. Let’s be honest and clear, without NATO’s air strikes, the no-fly zone, and the sanctions against Qaddafi, the civil war in Libya would have dragged on even longer, and rebel victory would have been extremely difficult if not impossible to achieve.


The majority of the protesters in Syria do not want Western military intervention. Their position is both courageous and rational, but it is not without costs and risks. With external military assistance (if the West sends arms or launches another NATO aerial campaign), they would be in a better position operationally to overthrow Assad, but their ability to govern their country in the future autonomously would be more limited (surely nothing is for free in international relations).


Without external military assistance, they are extremely vulnerable and at the mercy of Assad’s tanks and security forces, but if they pull his overthrow off, they will own their country’s future and put themselves in a position to better ward off future foreign meddling and interference. It is not an easy choice, but so far, the Syrian protesters have decided to go it alone, and one must understand and respect their remarkable position.


While the balance of forces currently tilts heavily in Assad’s favor, Qaddafis downfall might just be the necessary factor that will embolden the protesters and offer them a sizeable advantage. This is not naïve or farfetched. After all, it was the plight of Tunisian vendor Mohamed Bouazizi and the symbolism of his fate that sparked all the revolutions across the Middle East.


The images of the rebels in Libya liberating their country (as it seems they are close to doing) and chanting songs of freedom, like their Egyptian and Tunisian counterparts before them, will no doubt be another powerful inspiration and morale booster for the Syrian people.


Qaddafi’s departure will also make it possible for the international community to devote more attention and energy to Syria and come up with more creative and coordinated policies to assist the Syrian people, short of bombing Damascus or sending arms. That all eyes are currently on Assad is certainly bad news for the dictator.


Yet whatever the international community devises, the Syrian protest movement must do a better job organizing and convincing the world that it is more or less ready to take over once Assad falls. For that, the protesters need to create a truly united and inclusive political front (the National Council which the Syrian opposition formed today in Istanbul is a good first step, but it remains leaderless and still needs to come up with a tangible platform that goes beyond the demands for freedom and regime change).


Interviews with Arab intellectuals and ordinary citizens broadcast on satellite TV channels across the Arab world tell us that many Arabs believe that the rebels in Libya have made a mistake in asking for Western (“colonial”) military intervention. But the rebels' salvation is that they quickly came together and formed a transitional council, gaining world recognition and persuading major powers that the alternative to Qaddafi is indeed viable.


Right now, the West, and especially Syria’s neighbors, are concerned that Assad’s departure will lead to chaos and perhaps even sectarian, civil war that could spill over to other parts of the region.


Nobody and no amount of external assistance can help the Syrian protesters overcome their differences (as a Lebanese citizen, trust me on this one). But the sooner they speak with one voice, organize their ranks from within, and show the world that they are a mature and capable group able to turn Syria into a responsible democracy, the closer they will be to fulfilling their dream of toppling the Assad regime.


Their unity and organization are indeed more powerful than NATO’s bombs and more effective than the West’s sanctions. The lessons of Libya, Egypt, and Tunisia are clear: With unity comes historic opportunity.

Assad's Chemical Romance


Leonard Spector





AUGUST 23, 2011 -- The continued unrest in Syria, coupled with President Barack Obama's call for President Bashar al-Assad to leave power, has thrown the future of the country into flux. Among the most troubling uncertainties is the fate of Syria's chemical weapons arsenal, which, if not protected properly, could fall into the wrong hands, with catastrophic results. Syria is one of a handful of states that the U.S. government believes possess large stocks of chemical agents in militarized form -- that is, ready for use in artillery shells and bombs. The arsenal is thought to be massive, involving thousands of munitions and many tons of chemical agent, which range, according to CIA annual reports to Congress, from the blister gases of World War I -- such as mustard gas -- to advanced nerve agents such as sarin and possibly persistent nerve agents, such as VX gas. 


In the hands of Assad -- and his father Hafez before him -- these weapons have been an ace-in-the-hole deterrent against Israel's nuclear capability. The Assad regime, however, has never openly brandished this capability: It did not employ chemical weapons in the 1982 Lebanon War against Israel, even after Israeli warplanes decimated the Syrian Air Force. Nor have they been deployed, or their use threatened, in attempting to bring Assad's current domestic antagonists to heel. And although Syria is accused of providing powerful missiles to Hezbollah, including some of a type that carried chemical warfare agents in the Soviet arsenal, Assad has not reportedly transferred lethal chemical capabilities to the Lebanon-based Shiite organization. 


So despite their many faults and deplorable record on human rights, the Assads have treated their chemical arsenal with considerable care. But as the country potentially descends into chaos, will that hold true? 


Let's start with the possibility of civil war. According to researchers at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, open sources indicate that there are at least four, and potentially five, chemical weapons production facilities in Syria. One or two are located near Damascus, the other three situated in Hama, Latakia, and al-Safira village, near the city of Aleppo. Hama is one of the hotbeds of the Syrian revolt, which Assad's tanks attacked in early August and where, more recently, fighting has severely damaged the city's hospitals. Latakia is another center of unrest; it was shelled by the Syrian Navy in mid-August. Aleppo, Syria's second-largest city has also seen significant demonstrations. 


If anti-Assad insurgents take up arms, the chemical sites, as symbols of regime's authority, could become strategic targets. And, if mass defections occur from the Syrian army, there may be no one left to defend the sites against seizure. This could lead to disastrous outcomes -- including confiscation of the chemical weapons by a radical new national government, or sale of the weapons as war booty to organized non-state actors or criminal groups. 


In such chaos, no one can predict who might control the weapons or where they might be taken. With these chemical weapons in the hands of those engaged in a possible civil war, the risks that they would be used would increase substantially. The problem would be worsened further if some possessors were not fully aware of the extent of the weapons' deadly effects. 


And let's imagine that Assad is eventually removed: What leaders would gain control of these weapons after he departed? Saudi-backed Sunni groups? Iran-backed Shia organizations? Whoever they might be, it is unclear that the newcomers would follow the Assads' cautious-use doctrine and refusal to share chemical weapons with non-state groups, or that the new leaders would be able to maintain strict security measures at the chemical sites. 


Meanwhile, it's possible that an existential threat will cause the Assad regime to abandon its previous policy of restraint regarding chemical weapons. It is not a huge leap from attacking civilians with tank fire, machine guns, and naval artillery to deploying poison gas, and the shock effect and sense of dread engendered by even limited use could quash a city-wide uprising within an hour. 


The options available to the United States to minimize these risks are limited at best. Washington has certainly warned Assad against using the weapons domestically. But with Assad already at risk of indictment for crimes against humanity, and given his likely belief that the United States will not intervene militarily due to its commitments elsewhere -- including its politically unpopular and still opaque involvement in Libya -- U.S. warnings may have little deterrent effect. 


A preemptive Israeli military strike to destroy the weapons does not appear technically feasible: Even if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu were ready to change the status quo, Assad is believed to have stored bulk chemical agents and filled (or quickly filled) shells and bombs in underground bunkers at multiple sites throughout the country. Moreover, even if Israel used incendiary bombs in an attempt to incinerate the chemical agents, the risk of dispersing large quantities of poisonous liquids would remain, with the potential to cause large-scale casualties. 


The Obama administration needs to start planning now to manage Assad's chemical weapons legacy. If a new government replaces Assad -- or even if different groups compete for international recognition -- a U.S.-led coalition, including Turkey and the leading Arab states, should demand as a condition of support that the weapons immediately be placed under control of international monitors from the Hague-based Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and plans developed for their destruction. Hopefully, Syria's new leaders will have genuine legitimacy and will not need to prop up their credibility at home by clinging to these barbaric weapons.

10 years after 9/11, al-Qaeda is down but not out


David Ignatius





August 24 -- Government officials refer to it blandly as the “SSE,” or Sensitive Site Exploitation. That’s their oblique term for the extraordinary cache of evidence that was carried away from Osama bin Laden’s compound the night the al-Qaeda leader was killed.


With the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks a few weeks away, it’s possible to use this evidence to sketch a vivid portrait of al-Qaeda, drawing on material contained in more than 100 computer storage devices, including thumb drives, DVDs and CDs, and more than a dozen computers or hard drives — all collected during the May 2 raid.


U.S. officials say three strong themes emerge from their reading of the files, most of which were communications between bin Laden and his top deputy Atiyah Abd al-Rahman. Indeed, because the Libyan-born Atiyah (who’s known to analysts by his first name) was the boss’s key link with the outside, officials see him as more important than bin Laden’s nominal successor, Ayman al-Zawahiri.


Here are the highlights:


●Bin Laden retained until his death a passion to launch a significant attack against the United States, ideally linked to the 10th anniversary of 9/11. He and Atiyah communicated often about who might carry out such a strike, with Atiyah proposing names and bin Laden rejecting them. Bin Laden was still looking for a history-changing attack on big, economically important targets — one that would match, if not outdo, the impact of 9/11. Zawahiri, by contrast, favored an opportunistic strategy of smaller strikes.


●Bin Laden was a hands-on chief executive, with a role in operations planning and personnel decisions, rather than the detached senior leader that U.S. analysts had hypothesized. Zawahiri, whom the analysts had imagined as the day-to-day leader, was actually quite isolated — and remains so, despite a dozen communications this year. Zawahiri suffers from mistrust between his Egyptian faction of al-Qaeda and other operatives, such as Atiyah.


●Bin Laden was suffering badly from drone attacks on al-Qaeda’s base in the tribal areas of Pakistan. He called this the “intelligence war,” and said it was “the only weapon that’s hurting us.” His cadres complained that they couldn’t train in the tribal areas, couldn’t communicate, couldn’t travel easily and couldn’t draw new recruits to what amounted to a free-fire zone. Bin Laden discussed moving al-Qaeda’s base to another location, but he never took action.


Analysts did not find in the material any smoking gun to suggest Pakistani government complicity in bin Laden’s presence in Abbottabad. And it’s clear he was paranoid about being found and killed: He ordered his subordinates to restrict movements to help preserve what remained of al-Qaeda in Pakistan. Fear of being discovered was a subject of regular conversation between bin Laden, Atiyah, Zawahiri and others.


Bin Laden also worried that al-
Qaeda’s status among Muslims was dwindling, and that the West had at least partially succeeded in distancing al-Qaeda’s message from core Islamic values. Concerned about this eroding base, bin Laden counseled affiliates in North Africa and Yemen to hold back on their efforts to develop a local Islamic extremist state in favor of attacking the United States and its interests.


This fear that al-Qaeda’s extreme tactics were burning too hot and alienating Muslims was also the theme of a remarkable message that Atiyah sent in 2005 to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the murderous chief of al-Qaeda in Iraq. In this document, made public five years ago by the United States, Atiyah warned that fomenting Sunni-Shiite violence (which was Zarqawi’s trademark) was potentially ruinous.


The al-Qaeda that emerges from these documents is a badly battered and disoriented group. The June 3 death of Ilyas Kashmiri in a drone attack illustrates the organization’s continuing vulnerability. Kashmiri was a ruthless operator who planned the 2008 Mumbai attacks that killed 166 people and was plotting deadly attacks on Europe last winter that were stopped only because of aggressive counterterrorism work. (Security services from Europe and Turkey arrested about 20 of Kashmiri’s operatives before they could carry out the attacks.)


When top U.S. officials summarize their view of al-Qaeda now, in the run-up to the 9/11 anniversary, they describe an organization that is down but certainly not out. They don’t know of any specific plots targeting the United States, 10 years on. But they’re looking, pulsing every channel they know. They recognize that it’s what we still don’t know about al-Qaeda that’s most dangerous.

Why Golda Meir was right


Burak Bekdil 





August 23, 2011 -- It has been more than two and a half years since Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan told to Israeli President Shimon Peres’s face, “You (Jews) know well how to kill.” Prime Minister Erdoğan has also declared more than a few times that the main obstacle to peace in this part of the world is Israel, once calling the Jewish state “a festering boil in the Middle East that spreads hate and enmity.” In this holy month of Ramadan full of blood on Muslim territories, let’s try to identify who are the ones who know well how to kill.  As the Syrian death count clicks every day to come close to 2,000, the Turkish-Kurdish death count does not stop, already over 40,000 since 1984, both adding to the big pool of blood called the Middle East. Only during this Ramadan, the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK’s, death toll has reached 50 in this Muslim Kurds vs. Muslim Turks war. This excludes the PKK casualties in Turkey and in northern Iraq due to Turkish military retaliation since they are seldom accurately reported.


Let’s speak of facts.


Sudan is not in the conventional Middle East, so let’s ignore the genocide there. Let’s ignore, also, the West Pakistani massacres in East Pakistan (Bangladesh) totaling 1.25 million in 1971. Or 200,000 deaths in Algeria in war between Islamists and the government in 1991-2006.  But a simple, strictly Middle East research will give you one million deaths in the all-Muslim Iran-Iraq war; 300,000 Muslim minorities killed by Saddam Hussein; 80,000 Iranians killed during the Islamic revolution; 25,000 deaths in 1970-71, the days of Black September, by the Jordanian government in its fight against the Palestinians; and 20,000 Islamists killed in 1982 by the elder al-Assad in Hama. The World Health Organization’s estimate of Osama bin Laden’s carnage in Iraq was already 150,000 a few years earlier.


In a 2007 research, Gunnar Heinsohn from the University of Bremen and Daniel Pipes, director of the Middle East Forum, found out that some 11 million Muslims have been violently killed since 1948, of which 35,000, (0.3 percent) died during the six years of Arab war against Israel, or one out of every 315 fatalities. In contrast, over 90 percent who perished were killed by fellow Muslims.  According to Mssrs. Heinsohn and Pipes, the grisly inventory finds the total number of deaths in conflicts all over the world since 1950 numbering around 85 million. Of that, the Muslim Arab deaths in the Arab-Israeli conflict were at 46,000 including 11,000 during Israel’s war of independence. That makes 0.05 percent of all deaths in all conflicts, or 0.4 percent of all Arab deaths in the Arab-Israeli conflict.


In another calculation ignoring “small” massacres like the one that goes on in Syria and other deaths during the Arab Spring, only Saddam’s Iraq, Jordan, the elder al-Assad’s Syria, Iran-Iraq war, the bin Laden campaign in Iraq, the Iranian Islamic revolution and the Turkish-Kurdish conflict caused 1.65 million Muslim deaths by Muslims compared to less than 50,000 deaths in the Arab-Israeli conflict since 1950, including fatalities during and after Operation Cast Lead which came after the Heinsohn-Pipes study. For those who don’t have a calculator ready at their desks, allow me to tell: 50,000 is three percent of 1.65 million.  Golda Meir, the fourth prime minister of Israel, or rather the “Mother of Israel,” had a perfectly realistic point when she said that peace in the Middle East would only be possible “when Arabs love their children more than they hate us.”

NYT   U.S. Hones Warnings to Egypt as Military Stalls Transition   David D. Kirkpatrick and Steven Lee Myers      November 16, 2011 -- CAIRO — Brazen attempts by Egypt’s interim military rulers to hold on to power long after elections have elicited a sharp reaction domestically and for the first time have prompted Washington to warn about the potential for new unrest.    After months of mixing gentle pressure with broad support for the ruling military council, the Obama administration has sharpened its tone, senior administration officials say, expressing concern that the failure to move to civilian control could undermine the defining revolt of the Arab Spring.    The shift in tone is part of a difficult balancing act for Washington, which is keen to preserve its ties to the military and its interests in the region, chiefly Egypt’s role in maintaining peace with Israel. But Washington also hopes to win favor with Egypt’s newly empowered political opposition while avoiding the appearance of endorsing the militarys stalled transition to democracy. All things considered, some here have suggested, the change in tone may be intended to placate Egyptian public opinion rather than actually press the military to give up power.    “I think they are working for their own interests, particularly regarding the slow transition of power,” said Shady el-Ghazaly Harb, a prominent liberal activist who was among the leaders of the Egyptian revolution. “The U.S. wants to guarantee that the coming government will be on good terms — I won’t say loyal, but friendly — and the support for SCAF is related to that.” SCAF is the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, Egypt’s ruling military council.    Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton underscored the shift in a speech last week that her aides later said was a deliberate warning to the military council, which assumed power after President Hosni Mubarak’s ouster. The military had initially pledged to hand over control to civilians by September, but it now says that a presidential election will not occur before 2013. And last week it laid out a blueprint for the next constitution, giving the military special political powers and protection from civilian oversight into perpetuity.    “If, over time, the most powerful political force in Egypt remains a roomful of unelected officials, they will have planted the seeds for future unrest, and Egyptians will have missed a historic opportunity,” Mrs. Clinton warned.    “When unelected authorities say they want to be out of the business of governing,” the United States expects them “to lay out a clear road map” and “abide by it,” she added.    Given Washington’s long support for Mr. Mubarak, and Mrs. Clinton’s comment last month approving of the military’s extended timetable for electing a civilian president, there was suspicion over Washington’s intentions. The shift occurred at the same time as a broader effort by the Obama administration to counter anti-American sentiment and reach out to opposition leaders across the political spectrum.    The United States “wants to have the cake and eat it, too,” said Nabil Fahmy, a former Egyptian ambassador to Washington, arguing that the United States wants to promote democracy without dealing with the pressure it would put on American interests in the region.    The military’s attempts to protect its power and privileges indefinitely have created an awkward situation for Washington. The United States, through the Pentagon in particular, has long nurtured close ties with the Egyptian military, which still receives $1.3 billion in American aid each year. American officials hope that whatever government emerges will continue to support American policy, including maintaining ties with Israel and distance from Iran.    At the same time, the United States’ standing in public opinion in Egypt and around the region continues to suffer because of decades of support for undemocratic governments like the military-backed system that controlled Egypt under Mr. Mubarak. Remaining aloof from the debate over the military’s future role here risks reinforcing those criticisms at a time when democratic changes are giving public opinion new weight.    As part of its broader outreach, the Obama administration has also met with the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist group whose political party is poised to win a major role in the country’s new Parliament and remains the biggest political counterweight to the military council.    Jacob Walles, a deputy assistant secretary of state, met for the first time this week with the leaders of the Brotherhood’s newly formed Freedom and Justice Party at its new headquarters in Cairo. While American diplomats have had intermittent contacts for years with Brotherhood lawmakers in the Egyptian Parliament, officials here said Mr. Walles’s meeting appeared to underscore Mrs. Clinton’s pledges to cooperate with Islamist parties that respect democracy.    Others said it might instead have been a sign that Washington simply realized that the Brotherhood was certain to play a crucial role in Egypt’s future and was likely to win a large bloc of seats in the parliamentary elections that begin this month.    “They confirmed that they are keen to support the democratic process, and they will accept any results of the elections and deal with any government that respects human rights and the rights of women and minorities and the democratic process,” said Essam el-Erian, a veteran Brotherhood leader and the vice chairman of its new party, who met with Mr. Walles. “And we are keen and eager to say that we respect the democratic process and the rights of all people according to the Constitution and the law.”    Administration officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private diplomatic exchanges, said they hoped that a combination of internal and external pressure on the council would persuade it to yield power and submit to civilian oversight. In addition to the public comments by Mrs. Clinton, other senior American officials have privately urged the council to revise its recent proposals to preserve power, the officials said.    The officials noted that since Mr. Mubarak’s ouster, the council’s leaders had repeatedly offered, then backed away from, some proposals only after street protests and public pressure, in a kind of prolonged back-and-forth that some noted reflected a true, if messy, democratic process taking root.    But administration officials and Egyptian activists note worrying signs. The military core of Mr. Mubarak’s government has “reasserted itself again,” a senior administration official said. “We don’t have great expectations that this is going to be the creation of a democratic system,” the official said, referring to the coming elections.    At best, the official added, the elections will be “a transition to a transition,” one that could leave the military as the de facto power in Egypt for years to come, as it was under Mr. Mubarak’s rule.    The military has said that it intends to hold ultimate political power even after the election of a Parliament in the coming months, and that it will play a role in drafting the constitution as well. It has refused to lift the Mubarak-era “emergency law” allowing arrests without trial, and it has sent as many as 12,000 civilians to military trials.    While the administration’s changes in tone risk upsetting a pivotal ally where anti-American sentiment — and, in some quarters, support for the military — runs high, they are also drawing rare praise from activists here who say they appreciate Washington’s help.    “I think that Secretary of State Mrs. Clinton delivered a clear-cut message to the SCAF, and I think they got that message: that the SCAF is not an elected body and must deliver the authority and turn over power,” said Emad Gad, an analyst at the government-financed Al Ahram research institute and now a leader of the Social Democratic Party.    Mr. Gad contended that over the long term such pressure could only benefit the American relationship with a democratic Egypt. “I think more than 50 percent of the Egyptians think the SCAF is trying to kill the Egyptian revolution,” he said.           Article 2.   NYT   Europe’s Contagion   Editorial      November 16, 2011 -- Two years of gross mismanagement of the euro-zone debt crisis have all too predictably produced a wider crisis of market confidence that now threatens the entire 17-nation euro zone. This week’s formation of new technocrat-led governments in Greece and Italy has not calmed fears. Practically every euro zone country is paying the price in higher interest costs and ebbing economic growth.    The only country that isn’t suffering — yet — is Germany, whose competitive export-driven economy feeds on foreign demand and an exchange rate held down by its neighbors’ troubles. But all European countries cannot be Germany and run net surpluses, especially if Berlin insists on policies that keep factories shuttered and workers unemployed.    And German leaders are wrong if they think their country will remain unscathed as its major trading partners and neighbors unravel.    Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany has been talking a more pro-European line. But she is still insisting on growth-killing austerity as the price for European bailouts and still blocking the European Central Bank from printing more euros and acting as a lender of last resort.    Mrs. Merkel’s advisers insist that she is doing what the German people want. That is not leadership. She needs to challenge her voters simplistic stereotypes of southern European sloth and tell them the truth: The real threat to Germany isn’t inflation; it is an economic collapse across Europe. And Germany has a huge amount to lose from a fracturing of the European Union.    European stock and bond markets are already treating that as an ever-more-realistic possibility, shunning even moderate levels of risk and pushing interest rates to unsustainable levels. As far as they can see, Mrs. Merkel and her fellow euro-zone leaders haven’t come up with an adequate plan, sufficient political will or sufficient cash to halt the contagion. As far as we can see, they are right.    The political changes at the top of Greece and Italy are promising. Greece’s new prime minister, Lucas Papademos, and Mario Monti of Italy are internationally credible economists, committed to making painful but much needed reforms, including liberalizing labor markets, shrinking overgrown bureaucracies, shedding state properties and rooting out corruption.    Given their training, they surely understand that their economies are not now strong enough to absorb more austerity, including broad new taxes or further sweeping service cuts. Mr. Papademos and Mr. Monti should press their fellow European leaders for a new and better deal. Even with the best leadership, neither Greece nor Italy will be able, on their own, to restore their fiscal health and help slow the spreading financial contagion. That will require substantial and immediate help from their euro-zone partners, starting with Mrs. Merkel.    An all-out effort by the European Central Bank to buy bonds, lower interest rates and inject new liquidity into the markets may still calm the contagion if it begins in the next few days. The bank’s new president, Mario Draghi, may be willing to play this role, if Germany stops standing in the way.    Mrs. Merkel must make clear that she will support the central bank taking on this expanded role. And now that new, credible leaders are in office in Athens and Rome, she and other euro-zone leaders need to meet with them and negotiate more growth-friendly reform packages. There is very little time left to avoid financial catastrophe.     Article 3.   New York Post   High stakes in Syria   Amir Taheri      November 16, 2011 -- As Arab foreign ministers met in Rabat, Morocco, yesterday to discuss Syria, one question was on every mind: Is the country already in a civil war?   Some of the facts on the ground suggest so. With more than 350 killed so far, November has been the bloodiest month since the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad began last spring.   Defections from the army, which started as a trickle, now look like a torrent. In October, the number was around 800. The best total now available is about 17,000. The defectors have organized themselves as the Free Syrian Army and are creating credible command-and-control structures.   Since September, the FSA has carried out a number of symbolic attacks against the regime. And now the “shadow army,” as Syrians call it, seems to be planning more spectacular operations.   On Monday, the FSA claimed an attack on an army convoy near Deraa, the southwestern town where the revolution started. Official accounts reported at least 34 soldiers killed.   Yesterday, the FSA attacked the headquarters of the Air Force Intelligence Agency at Harasta near the capital Damascus. Since Hafez al-Assad, an air-force officer and Bashar’s father, seized power in a coup in 1970, the AIA has been the nerve center of the regime’s security system.   Also this week, reports surfaced of attacks by armed tribesmen on three military outposts near the Iraqi border.   Despite all that, it may be premature to speak of civil war in Syria.    In a civil war, a society is divided into armed camps that, initially at least, are roughly the same size. That’s not the case in Syria, where the uprising is backed by an overwhelming majority against a government that’s dominated by a small minority — the Ba’ath Party. To make matters worse, the Ba’ath is dominated by the Nusairi (Alawite) religious minority, a mere 5 percent of the population.   Thus, Syria’s is a nationwide revolution against a minority regime.   Almost all Syrians agree that the situation is untenable. Assad’s policy of rule by massacre has few supporters outside his clan. Judging by the revolution’s most popular slogan — “Assad Get Out!”— a majority may support demands for Assad to stand down, as suggested by Jordan’s King Abdullah.   Nevertheless, the Assad clan still controls enough military and financial assets to continue its rule-by-massacre strategy.    The result could be the disintegration of the Syrian army and the emergence of armed groups beyond the control of either the government or the Syrian National Council, the opposition’s umbrella organization. That could lead to violence spilling into neighboring countries, especially Iraq and Lebanon.   Rather than speculating about a civil war, the Arab League and the international community should focus on the dangers that the Syrian situation poses for regional peace.    A Franco-British resolution on Syria won a majority at the UN Security Council last month but was killed by Russian and Chinese vetoes. The Security Council should take up the issue again — this time to debate the threat to the region.   Last month, Russia and China tried to justify their vetoes by claiming that the Arab states were divided over Syria. This wasn’t true then and is less so now. The Arab League has suspended Syria’s membership and condemned the rule-by-massacre policy. Arab support is also building up for creating havens for Syrian refugees in Turkey, Lebanon, Iraq and Jordan.   Moscow had also expressed concern that, with Assad’s demise, a new Syrian government might “ignore Russia’s interests in the Middle East.” Since the vetoes, however, the Syrian National Council has established contact with Russia and China to offer assurances that a democratic Syria would pursue “cooperation with all nations.”   SNC sources tell me that they’ve also “opened a dialogue” with Iran, Assad’s main supporter, amid signs that it, too, may no longer be so sure about the despot’s chances of survival.   America must take the lead in mobilizing international support for the Syrian revolution. By removing one of the last regimes that still sponsors terrorism, the victory of democracy in Syria is in America’s best national interests.                    Article 4.   Guardian   Turkey has a key role in Syria – now and in the future   Simon Tisdall       16 November 2011 -- The Arab League's unexpectedly tough action in suspending Syria, ostracising President Bashar al-Assad, and inviting opposition leaders to talks in Cairo has outraged the regime in Damascus, which suspects a US-led conspiracy to impose forcible regime change. But the increased hostility exhibited by Turkey, Syria's most powerful and best-connected neighbour, may yet prove decisive as Ankara assumes a crisis leadership role.   Until the uprising tore apart old certainties, the Turkish prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, had invested considerable capital in improved ties with Syria, with which Turkey almost went to war in the 1990s. A turning point came with the 2004 free trade agreement. This interdependence now gives Turkey significant economic leverage. Ankara has already imposed unilateral sanctions and is considering additional measures including a cut in electricity supplies.   Erdogan turned the screw again this week, accusing Assad personally of "feeding on blood" after he failed to honour the Arab League peace plan. "No regime can survive by killing or jailing," he said. "No one can build a future over the blood of the oppressed."   Turkey's motives are not difficult to discern. Chaos on its fragile southern flank, and Syria's possible descent into civil war, would be reasons enough to prompt Ankara's intervention. But Erdogan was also incensed by weekend attacks on Turkey's embassy in Damascus and regional consulates, apparently orchestrated by the regime. The government issued a formal protest and advised Turks against travel to Syria, a reversal of its proud open-borders policy.   Turkey also appears motivated by a desire to keep ahead of evolving Arab opinion. "It can comfortably be said, in light of recent developments, that the countdown to the end of Syria's Assad regime has begun," said Today's Zaman columnist Bülent Kenes, reflecting official opinion.   With senior Saudi officials and King Abdullah of Jordan openly backing the revolt, and the violence escalating, Erdogan and his foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, who have long harboured regional leadership ambitions, seem to be positioning themselves for a post-Assad future.   In this push towards the Syrian endgame they plainly have the enthusiastic backing of the US, for whom they are effectively acting as a local proxy in opposition to external actors such as the pro-regime Russia. Given Erdogan's sharp differences with Washington over Israel-Palestine and the Iraq war, this coincidence of view is not lacking in irony. "We very much welcome the strong stance that Turkey has taken and believe it sends a critical message to President Assad that … he should step down," said Ben Rhodes, Barack Obama's deputy national security adviser.   In a series of statements, Davutoglu has insisted it is "no longer possible to trust the Syrian government". Adding provocation to insult, he underscored Ankara's support for the protesters and specifically for the Syrian National Council, an opposition umbrella group based in Turkey that is seeking recognition from Ankara. "We will continue to take our place at the side of the Syrian people's rightful struggle," Davutoglu said.   As bilateral tensions rise, suggestions that Turkey may physically intervene in northern Syria to create a safe haven for civilians displaced by the violence are likely to resurface. Several thousand Syrian refugees are already sheltering inside Turkey, as are numerous Syrian army defectors. Possibly anticipating Syrian retaliation, the newspaper Hürriyet reported that President Abdullah Gül recently warned Assad would pay a heavy price for stirring up trouble in Turkey's Kurdish south-east.   Fears that a Syrian meltdown could seriously destabilise the wider neighbourhood are also driving Turkey's hardening response. Such a scenario could affect Iraq, where security concerns are rising as the US withdrawal nears completion, and even Iran, a close Assad ally.   For its part, the Syrian regime has pressing reasons to fear Ankara's animosity, as Gökhan Bacik pointed out in Today's Zaman. Unlike many Muslim countries, Turkey identifies strongly with Europe, the US and Nato. And in the past decade, Erdogan's Justice and Development party has made its brand of moderate Islamist politics acceptable to previously blinkered western eyes.   In other words, Turkey, with its majority Sunni Muslim population, furnishes a role model for the disenfranchised Sunni majority in Syria (and other Arab spring countries). Not only is Ankara encouraging revolution in Damascus, it is also living proof that Assad's politics of fear are outdated, that Syrians have before them a workable alternative paradigm, and that, after the revolution, the country's secular, Islamist and other sectarian traditions could fairly hope to co-exist peacefully, Turkish-style.               Article 5.   Foreign Policy   Barack Obama's Foreign Policy   November 16, 2011     Foreign-policy credentials: As president, Obama has taken on a number of major foreign-policy initiatives, including a renewed troop surge in Afghanistan, the negotiation of the New START nuclear arms reduction treaty with Russia, the NATO intervention in Libya, the withdrawal from Iraq, ongoing trade negotiations with China, and of course, the killing of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.     Overview: Obama is a much different candidate today from the senator who distinguished himself by his opposition to the "dumb war" on his way to the presidency in 2008. Obama has turned out, in many ways, to have pursued a fairly conventional, at times, hawkish foreign policy. He has had some notable successes, such as the bin Laden raid and this year's withdrawal from Iraq -- albeit on a timetable negotiated by his predecessor -- and the successful overthrow of Muammar al-Qaddafi. All the same, "apology tours" and "leading from behind" -- referring to an unfortunate description of Obama's diplomatic strategy by a White House staffer -- have already become buzzwords for Republican candidates. He has also faced heavy criticism on the left for a sometimes inconsistent approach to international law in counterterrorism operations.      But with a significant economic recovery appearing unlikely and fewer domestic achievements to point to than he might have expected, coupled with the international inexperience of his opponents, Obama may make his foreign-policy wins the centerpiece of his reelection strategy.      Advisors: Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, National Security Advisor Thomas Donilon.      On the issues:      Afghanistan/Pakistan: "We have put al Qaeda on a path to defeat," Obama announced last June, noting that the 33,000 "surge" troops he sent to Afghanistan in 2009 would be out of the country by the summer of 2012. Although a constant barrage of drone strikes and special operations raids have taken a harsh toll on al Qaeda, it may be difficult for Obama to make the case that Afghanistan has achieved stability or that Hamid Karzai's government can stand on its own without U.S. assistance.      Relations with Pakistan have deteriorated significantly under Obama's tenure, particularly following the bin Laden raid. He has pledged to "constantly evaluate" the relationship between the two countries going forward but says he would be hesitant to cut off aid that could "help the Pakistani people strengthen their own society and their own government."      Military spending: Backed by his then current defense secretary, Robert Gates, Obama announced last April that the Pentagon will lead a "fundamental review" of U.S. military capabilities in order to cut $400 billion in defense spending over the next 10 years. "We need to not only eliminate waste and improve efficiency and effectiveness, but conduct a fundamental review of America's missions, capabilities, and our role in a changing world," Obama said. Of course, major cuts could come sooner than that if the congressional "supercommittee" fails to reach an agreement on deficit reduction by Nov. 23.      Immigration/borders: Obama insists that enacting comprehensive immigration reform, which would likely include a path to citizenship for at least some illegal immigrants already in the United States, is still a "top priority," but with little congressional enthusiasm for such a measure, it has been pushed to the back burner for now. Meanwhile, deportations of illegal immigrants are continuing at a record pace, though the administration touts the fact that a higher percentage of those deported have criminal records.      Obama has substantially increased the number of agents patrolling the U.S.-Mexico border, but has also mocked the fence-building enthusiasm of Republicans, saying they won't be happy until there's a "moat with alligators."      Israel/Palestine: Obama's engagement in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process has probably been the most frustrating foreign-policy initiative of his presidency and the one on which he is most often criticized by his Republican opponents. Obama continues to support negotiations on a two-state settlement of the conflict, but his best-remembered statement on the topic is controversial: his suggestion that Israel's pre-1967 war borders be taken as a starting point for negotiations, a position fiercely opposed by Israel. More recently, the administration has confirmed that it will veto Palestine's statehood bid in the U.N. Security Council.      Obama's relationship with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has seemed very strained at times. In a recently overheard conversation he told French President Nicolas Sarkozy, "You're fed up with him? I have to deal with him every day."      China: Obama has repeatedly criticized China -- most recently at the APEC summit in Honolulu -- for currency policies that he says have a distorting effect on the global economy. The president has made a few cautious statements on China's human rights record but came under criticism for delaying a White House meeting with the Dalai Lama. This year, the administration confirmed a $5.8 billion package of arms sales for Taiwan that provoked a predictable Chinese backlash.      Foreign aid: In his 2010 address to the U.N. General Assembly, Obama announced an overhaul of U.S. foreign aid policies, which he vowed will place them at the center of U.S. foreign policy. In the speech he called aid a "core pillar of American power." Nonetheless, foreign aid to a number of countries was cut by Congress in the 2012 budget.      Iran/nukes: Early in his presidency, Obama made several overtures to Iran in an effort to improve relations. Critics say this engagement strategy went too far during the 2009 Green Movement uprising against the reelection of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, when the Obama administration was reluctant to overtly back the protesters. Since then, the administration has instituted a number of new sanctions against Iran that are aimed at halting its nuclear enrichment program. "We are not taking any options off the table. Iran with nuclear weapons would pose a threat not only to the region but also to the United States," Obama said in a recent news conference in Hawaii.      Trade: In October, Obama signed long-delayed free trade agreements with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea. On his trip to Asia this November, Obama is working to promote a new trans-Pacific free trade agreement. "We're not going to be able to put our folks back to work and grow our economy and expand opportunity unless the Asia-Pacific region is also successful," he said. Obama has indefinitely put on hold a campaign promise to renegotiate NAFTA.      War on terror/detainees: Obama signed an executive order closing the Guantánamo Bay detention center as one of his first actions as president. The facility remains open, however, largely due to congressional opposition over where to house the remaining prisoners. Obama has put a halt to the "enhanced interrogation techniques" employed by George W. Bush's administration but has enraged some civil liberties advocates by authorizing the extrajudicial killing of alleged al Qaeda terrorist Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen. Obama has also disappointed some liberal supporters by resuming military trials of terrorism suspects at Guantánamo.      Environment: Despite his stated support for environmental legislation and green energy, there has been little progress on passing major climate-change bills under Obama's watch. Thanks largely to Obama's public intervention, an agreement was reached at the 2009 Copenhagen climate summit, but in failing to impose enforceable emissions targets, the meeting was widely considered a failure. This year, Obama abandoned tough new air-quality rules, adopted early in his administration.      Russia/reset: One of the centerpieces of Obama's first-term foreign policy was the effort to "reset" relations with Russia. The president successfully negotiated the New START nuclear reduction treaty, though there have been significant disagreements with both Russia and his GOP opponents over the contours of missile defense. Human rights advocates have criticized the president for ignoring the erosion of Russian democracy. Russia has also continued to stymie U.S. efforts to impose tough international sanctions on Iran and Syria. Obama seemed to have made friends with President Dmitry Medvedev, but relations with Russia may only get tougher, with Vladimir Putin's likely return to the Russian presidency.      Arab Spring: After a slow start, the Obama administration eventually came around to calling for Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to step down, joining the NATO intervention in Libya, and supporting stricter sanctions against Syria. The president has been less outspoken about other Persian Gulf allies, including Bahrain, which hosts a key U.S. naval base. Obama has urged Egypt and Tunisia to "set a strong example through free and fair elections, a vibrant civil society, accountable and effective democratic institutions, and responsible regional leadership."      Other issues: Although he once described himself as a George H.W. Bush-school realist, in the past year Obama has learned to embrace humanitarian intervention, both in Libya and in central Africa, where military advisors have been sent to aid in the fight against the long-running insurgency by the Lord's Resistance Army. There's speculation that Nigeria may be next. It's a measure of how much things have changed in the last four years that Republicans are now attacking the Democratic president for trying to spread democracy and human rights at the barrel of a gun.      As the European economic crisis has worsened, Obama has been speaking out more in support of strong measures to protect the common currency. "Ultimately what they are going to need is a firewall that sends a clear signal we stand behind the European project and we stand behind the euro," he said during his recent trip to Australia.             Article 6.   Project Syndicate   America in the Asian Century   Dominique Moisi      2011-11-15 – At “ground zero” in lower Manhattan, two empty spaces will be filled by water cascades, memorializing in a serene and respectful way the victims of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Next to them, a powerful tower, designed by the architect Daniel Libeskind and nearly completed, rises vigorously into the sky, a symbol of the triumph of life over the forces of death. One word comes to mind to characterize the impression made by this place, the site of an unprecedented crime: resilience.   In a building that houses what will one day be a memorial museum, one can buy a DVD entitled “9/12: From Chaos to Community.” Ground Zero is the architectural and human proof that, despite America’s current economic woes, it would be premature, if not dangerous, to write the country off as a declining power. America has the moral and intellectual resources that it needs in order to rebound.   But what is necessary is not sufficient. In order to reinvent itself, if not to manage its relative international decline, America must proceed toward a rebalancing of its domestic and international priorities. In the immediate aftermath of World War I, a triumphant America withdrew from global responsibility, with tragic consequences for the balance of power in a Europe that was left to face its inner demons alone.   In the aftermath of World War II, by contrast, the US managed successfully to contain Soviet ambitions. Today, unlike in 1945, Americans do not confront an imminent threat. Russia may speak loudly (using its permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council as a megaphone), but it is a greatly reduced rump of the Soviet Union. Likewise, while the nationalism of America’s principal rival, China, has become more assertive lately, the communist regime’s clear priority – indeed, the key to its stability – is domestic economic growth.   Indeed, the only obvious danger that the US faces stems from weapons of mass destruction, which could proliferate or be used by terrorist groups. But confronting this threat does not require a massive military budget or huge deployments of US troops all over the world. America has a much-needed opportunity to refocus on itself – to recover its inner strength without withdrawing from the world. As Richard Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, puts it, America must enter a period of “restoration” of its fundamentals.   American foreign policy starts at home, and that means reining in budget deficits over the long term, reviving economic growth and job creation in the short term, and addressing the country’s deteriorating infrastructure. Indeed, America’s “aged modernity” has become a drag on its competitiveness, as well as an insult to its international image and a risk to the safety of its citizens.   Moreover, imperial fatigue has set in. Recent US history has been characterized by cycles of enthusiasm about foreign engagement. In the mid-1970’s, following the war in Vietnam, America, guided by President Jimmy Carter’s moralizing impulse, opted for “regionalization” of its engagements. But, given that the Soviet threat still existed, this effort came too early (and probably was carried out in the wrong manner).   Today, by contrast, the starting point for a reassessment of American priorities is more economic than ethical. But the reasoning is the same, for it is based on the conviction that more America in the world today implies less costly and confused interventionism tomorrow. That means that US foreign policy itself – defined in recent years by too much attention to the Middle East, and too little to Asia – must embrace a shift in priorities.   Of course, in the midst of today’s ongoing Arab revolutions, America cannot simply ignore the Middle East. Nor must the US give up hope on the Israel-Palestine front, or on its efforts to contain Iran’s nuclear ambitions. But it is in Asia that history is unfolding – and where the US must define its long-term global strategy.   Must the US, as Henry Kissinger suggests in his latest book On China, consider the prospect of a “Pacific Community” that, unlike the Cold War-era Atlantic Community, is not based on common culture and values in the face of a direct threat, but on common interests in an “age of rebalancing of world order”?   America’s resilience may contrast with Europe’s multiple weaknesses. But resilience will not be enough. The US must get back into shape to face tomorrow’s challenges, and that means restoring economic growth, reducing deficits, and improving infrastructure. Paradoxically, only a more confident America can accept a reduced global status, because reconciling oneself to change is always easier once one has taken the steps needed to adjust to it.

U.S. Hones Warnings to Egypt as Military Stalls Transition


David D. Kirkpatrick and Steven Lee Myers





November 16, 2011 -- CAIRO — Brazen attempts by Egypt’s interim military rulers to hold on to power long after elections have elicited a sharp reaction domestically and for the first time have prompted Washington to warn about the potential for new unrest. 


After months of mixing gentle pressure with broad support for the ruling military council, the Obama administration has sharpened its tone, senior administration officials say, expressing concern that the failure to move to civilian control could undermine the defining revolt of the Arab Spring. 


The shift in tone is part of a difficult balancing act for Washington, which is keen to preserve its ties to the military and its interests in the region, chiefly Egypt’s role in maintaining peace with Israel. But Washington also hopes to win favor with Egypt’s newly empowered political opposition while avoiding the appearance of endorsing the militarys stalled transition to democracy. All things considered, some here have suggested, the change in tone may be intended to placate Egyptian public opinion rather than actually press the military to give up power. 


“I think they are working for their own interests, particularly regarding the slow transition of power,” said Shady el-Ghazaly Harb, a prominent liberal activist who was among the leaders of the Egyptian revolution. “The U.S. wants to guarantee that the coming government will be on good terms — I won’t say loyal, but friendly — and the support for SCAF is related to that.” SCAF is the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, Egypt’s ruling military council. 


Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton underscored the shift in a speech last week that her aides later said was a deliberate warning to the military council, which assumed power after President Hosni Mubarak’s ouster. The military had initially pledged to hand over control to civilians by September, but it now says that a presidential election will not occur before 2013. And last week it laid out a blueprint for the next constitution, giving the military special political powers and protection from civilian oversight into perpetuity. 


“If, over time, the most powerful political force in Egypt remains a roomful of unelected officials, they will have planted the seeds for future unrest, and Egyptians will have missed a historic opportunity,” Mrs. Clinton warned. 


“When unelected authorities say they want to be out of the business of governing,” the United States expects them “to lay out a clear road map” and “abide by it,” she added. 


Given Washington’s long support for Mr. Mubarak, and Mrs. Clinton’s comment last month approving of the military’s extended timetable for electing a civilian president, there was suspicion over Washington’s intentions. The shift occurred at the same time as a broader effort by the Obama administration to counter anti-American sentiment and reach out to opposition leaders across the political spectrum. 


The United States “wants to have the cake and eat it, too,” said Nabil Fahmy, a former Egyptian ambassador to Washington, arguing that the United States wants to promote democracy without dealing with the pressure it would put on American interests in the region. 


The military’s attempts to protect its power and privileges indefinitely have created an awkward situation for Washington. The United States, through the Pentagon in particular, has long nurtured close ties with the Egyptian military, which still receives $1.3 billion in American aid each year. American officials hope that whatever government emerges will continue to support American policy, including maintaining ties with Israel and distance from Iran. 


At the same time, the United States’ standing in public opinion in Egypt and around the region continues to suffer because of decades of support for undemocratic governments like the military-backed system that controlled Egypt under Mr. Mubarak. Remaining aloof from the debate over the military’s future role here risks reinforcing those criticisms at a time when democratic changes are giving public opinion new weight. 


As part of its broader outreach, the Obama administration has also met with the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist group whose political party is poised to win a major role in the country’s new Parliament and remains the biggest political counterweight to the military council. 


Jacob Walles, a deputy assistant secretary of state, met for the first time this week with the leaders of the Brotherhood’s newly formed Freedom and Justice Party at its new headquarters in Cairo. While American diplomats have had intermittent contacts for years with Brotherhood lawmakers in the Egyptian Parliament, officials here said Mr. Walles’s meeting appeared to underscore Mrs. Clinton’s pledges to cooperate with Islamist parties that respect democracy. 


Others said it might instead have been a sign that Washington simply realized that the Brotherhood was certain to play a crucial role in Egypt’s future and was likely to win a large bloc of seats in the parliamentary elections that begin this month. 


“They confirmed that they are keen to support the democratic process, and they will accept any results of the elections and deal with any government that respects human rights and the rights of women and minorities and the democratic process,” said Essam el-Erian, a veteran Brotherhood leader and the vice chairman of its new party, who met with Mr. Walles. “And we are keen and eager to say that we respect the democratic process and the rights of all people according to the Constitution and the law.” 


Administration officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private diplomatic exchanges, said they hoped that a combination of internal and external pressure on the council would persuade it to yield power and submit to civilian oversight. In addition to the public comments by Mrs. Clinton, other senior American officials have privately urged the council to revise its recent proposals to preserve power, the officials said. 


The officials noted that since Mr. Mubarak’s ouster, the council’s leaders had repeatedly offered, then backed away from, some proposals only after street protests and public pressure, in a kind of prolonged back-and-forth that some noted reflected a true, if messy, democratic process taking root. 


But administration officials and Egyptian activists note worrying signs. The military core of Mr. Mubarak’s government has “reasserted itself again,” a senior administration official said. “We don’t have great expectations that this is going to be the creation of a democratic system,” the official said, referring to the coming elections. 


At best, the official added, the elections will be “a transition to a transition,” one that could leave the military as the de facto power in Egypt for years to come, as it was under Mr. Mubarak’s rule. 


The military has said that it intends to hold ultimate political power even after the election of a Parliament in the coming months, and that it will play a role in drafting the constitution as well. It has refused to lift the Mubarak-era “emergency law” allowing arrests without trial, and it has sent as many as 12,000 civilians to military trials. 


While the administration’s changes in tone risk upsetting a pivotal ally where anti-American sentiment — and, in some quarters, support for the military — runs high, they are also drawing rare praise from activists here who say they appreciate Washington’s help. 


“I think that Secretary of State Mrs. Clinton delivered a clear-cut message to the SCAF, and I think they got that message: that the SCAF is not an elected body and must deliver the authority and turn over power,” said Emad Gad, an analyst at the government-financed Al Ahram research institute and now a leader of the Social Democratic Party. 


Mr. Gad contended that over the long term such pressure could only benefit the American relationship with a democratic Egypt. “I think more than 50 percent of the Egyptians think the SCAF is trying to kill the Egyptian revolution,” he said.

Europe’s Contagion


Editorial





November 16, 2011 -- Two years of gross mismanagement of the euro-zone debt crisis have all too predictably produced a wider crisis of market confidence that now threatens the entire 17-nation euro zone. This week’s formation of new technocrat-led governments in Greece and Italy has not calmed fears. Practically every euro zone country is paying the price in higher interest costs and ebbing economic growth. 


The only country that isn’t suffering — yet — is Germany, whose competitive export-driven economy feeds on foreign demand and an exchange rate held down by its neighbors’ troubles. But all European countries cannot be Germany and run net surpluses, especially if Berlin insists on policies that keep factories shuttered and workers unemployed. 


And German leaders are wrong if they think their country will remain unscathed as its major trading partners and neighbors unravel. 


Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany has been talking a more pro-European line. But she is still insisting on growth-killing austerity as the price for European bailouts and still blocking the European Central Bank from printing more euros and acting as a lender of last resort. 


Mrs. Merkel’s advisers insist that she is doing what the German people want. That is not leadership. She needs to challenge her voters simplistic stereotypes of southern European sloth and tell them the truth: The real threat to Germany isn’t inflation; it is an economic collapse across Europe. And Germany has a huge amount to lose from a fracturing of the European Union. 


European stock and bond markets are already treating that as an ever-more-realistic possibility, shunning even moderate levels of risk and pushing interest rates to unsustainable levels. As far as they can see, Mrs. Merkel and her fellow euro-zone leaders haven’t come up with an adequate plan, sufficient political will or sufficient cash to halt the contagion. As far as we can see, they are right. 


The political changes at the top of Greece and Italy are promising. Greece’s new prime minister, Lucas Papademos, and Mario Monti of Italy are internationally credible economists, committed to making painful but much needed reforms, including liberalizing labor markets, shrinking overgrown bureaucracies, shedding state properties and rooting out corruption. 


Given their training, they surely understand that their economies are not now strong enough to absorb more austerity, including broad new taxes or further sweeping service cuts. Mr. Papademos and Mr. Monti should press their fellow European leaders for a new and better deal. Even with the best leadership, neither Greece nor Italy will be able, on their own, to restore their fiscal health and help slow the spreading financial contagion. That will require substantial and immediate help from their euro-zone partners, starting with Mrs. Merkel. 


An all-out effort by the European Central Bank to buy bonds, lower interest rates and inject new liquidity into the markets may still calm the contagion if it begins in the next few days. The bank’s new president, Mario Draghi, may be willing to play this role, if Germany stops standing in the way. 


Mrs. Merkel must make clear that she will support the central bank taking on this expanded role. And now that new, credible leaders are in office in Athens and Rome, she and other euro-zone leaders need to meet with them and negotiate more growth-friendly reform packages. There is very little time left to avoid financial catastrophe.

High stakes in Syria


Amir Taheri





November 16, 2011 -- As Arab foreign ministers met in Rabat, Morocco, yesterday to discuss Syria, one question was on every mind: Is the country already in a civil war?


Some of the facts on the ground suggest so. With more than 350 killed so far, November has been the bloodiest month since the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad began last spring.


Defections from the army, which started as a trickle, now look like a torrent. In October, the number was around 800. The best total now available is about 17,000. The defectors have organized themselves as the Free Syrian Army and are creating credible command-and-control structures.


Since September, the FSA has carried out a number of symbolic attacks against the regime. And now the “shadow army,” as Syrians call it, seems to be planning more spectacular operations.


On Monday, the FSA claimed an attack on an army convoy near Deraa, the southwestern town where the revolution started. Official accounts reported at least 34 soldiers killed.


Yesterday, the FSA attacked the headquarters of the Air Force Intelligence Agency at Harasta near the capital Damascus. Since Hafez al-Assad, an air-force officer and Bashar’s father, seized power in a coup in 1970, the AIA has been the nerve center of the regime’s security system.


Also this week, reports surfaced of attacks by armed tribesmen on three military outposts near the Iraqi border.


Despite all that, it may be premature to speak of civil war in Syria. 


In a civil war, a society is divided into armed camps that, initially at least, are roughly the same size. That’s not the case in Syria, where the uprising is backed by an overwhelming majority against a government that’s dominated by a small minority — the Ba’ath Party. To make matters worse, the Ba’ath is dominated by the Nusairi (Alawite) religious minority, a mere 5 percent of the population.


Thus, Syria’s is a nationwide revolution against a minority regime.


Almost all Syrians agree that the situation is untenable. Assad’s policy of rule by massacre has few supporters outside his clan. Judging by the revolution’s most popular slogan — “Assad Get Out!”— a majority may support demands for Assad to stand down, as suggested by Jordan’s King Abdullah.


Nevertheless, the Assad clan still controls enough military and financial assets to continue its rule-by-massacre strategy. 


The result could be the disintegration of the Syrian army and the emergence of armed groups beyond the control of either the government or the Syrian National Council, the opposition’s umbrella organization. That could lead to violence spilling into neighboring countries, especially Iraq and Lebanon.


Rather than speculating about a civil war, the Arab League and the international community should focus on the dangers that the Syrian situation poses for regional peace. 


A Franco-British resolution on Syria won a majority at the UN Security Council last month but was killed by Russian and Chinese vetoes. The Security Council should take up the issue again — this time to debate the threat to the region.


Last month, Russia and China tried to justify their vetoes by claiming that the Arab states were divided over Syria. This wasn’t true then and is less so now. The Arab League has suspended Syria’s membership and condemned the rule-by-massacre policy. Arab support is also building up for creating havens for Syrian refugees in Turkey, Lebanon, Iraq and Jordan.


Moscow had also expressed concern that, with Assad’s demise, a new Syrian government might “ignore Russia’s interests in the Middle East.” Since the vetoes, however, the Syrian National Council has established contact with Russia and China to offer assurances that a democratic Syria would pursue “cooperation with all nations.”


SNC sources tell me that they’ve also “opened a dialogue” with Iran, Assad’s main supporter, amid signs that it, too, may no longer be so sure about the despot’s chances of survival.


America must take the lead in mobilizing international support for the Syrian revolution. By removing one of the last regimes that still sponsors terrorism, the victory of democracy in Syria is in America’s best national interests.

Turkey has a key role in Syria – now and in the future


Simon Tisdall 





16 November 2011 -- The Arab League's unexpectedly tough action in suspending Syria, ostracising President Bashar al-Assad, and inviting opposition leaders to talks in Cairo has outraged the regime in Damascus, which suspects a US-led conspiracy to impose forcible regime change. But the increased hostility exhibited by Turkey, Syria's most powerful and best-connected neighbour, may yet prove decisive as Ankara assumes a crisis leadership role.


Until the uprising tore apart old certainties, the Turkish prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, had invested considerable capital in improved ties with Syria, with which Turkey almost went to war in the 1990s. A turning point came with the 2004 free trade agreement. This interdependence now gives Turkey significant economic leverage. Ankara has already imposed unilateral sanctions and is considering additional measures including a cut in electricity supplies.


Erdogan turned the screw again this week, accusing Assad personally of "feeding on blood" after he failed to honour the Arab League peace plan. "No regime can survive by killing or jailing," he said. "No one can build a future over the blood of the oppressed."


Turkey's motives are not difficult to discern. Chaos on its fragile southern flank, and Syria's possible descent into civil war, would be reasons enough to prompt Ankara's intervention. But Erdogan was also incensed by weekend attacks on Turkey's embassy in Damascus and regional consulates, apparently orchestrated by the regime. The government issued a formal protest and advised Turks against travel to Syria, a reversal of its proud open-borders policy.


Turkey also appears motivated by a desire to keep ahead of evolving Arab opinion. "It can comfortably be said, in light of recent developments, that the countdown to the end of Syria's Assad regime has begun," said Today's Zaman columnist Bülent Kenes, reflecting official opinion.


With senior Saudi officials and King Abdullah of Jordan openly backing the revolt, and the violence escalating, Erdogan and his foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, who have long harboured regional leadership ambitions, seem to be positioning themselves for a post-Assad future.


In this push towards the Syrian endgame they plainly have the enthusiastic backing of the US, for whom they are effectively acting as a local proxy in opposition to external actors such as the pro-regime Russia. Given Erdogan's sharp differences with Washington over Israel-Palestine and the Iraq war, this coincidence of view is not lacking in irony. "We very much welcome the strong stance that Turkey has taken and believe it sends a critical message to President Assad that … he should step down," said Ben Rhodes, Barack Obama's deputy national security adviser.


In a series of statements, Davutoglu has insisted it is "no longer possible to trust the Syrian government". Adding provocation to insult, he underscored Ankara's support for the protesters and specifically for the Syrian National Council, an opposition umbrella group based in Turkey that is seeking recognition from Ankara. "We will continue to take our place at the side of the Syrian people's rightful struggle," Davutoglu said.


As bilateral tensions rise, suggestions that Turkey may physically intervene in northern Syria to create a safe haven for civilians displaced by the violence are likely to resurface. Several thousand Syrian refugees are already sheltering inside Turkey, as are numerous Syrian army defectors. Possibly anticipating Syrian retaliation, the newspaper Hürriyet reported that President Abdullah Gül recently warned Assad would pay a heavy price for stirring up trouble in Turkey's Kurdish south-east.


Fears that a Syrian meltdown could seriously destabilise the wider neighbourhood are also driving Turkey's hardening response. Such a scenario could affect Iraq, where security concerns are rising as the US withdrawal nears completion, and even Iran, a close Assad ally.


For its part, the Syrian regime has pressing reasons to fear Ankara's animosity, as Gökhan Bacik pointed out in Today's Zaman. Unlike many Muslim countries, Turkey identifies strongly with Europe, the US and Nato. And in the past decade, Erdogan's Justice and Development party has made its brand of moderate Islamist politics acceptable to previously blinkered western eyes.


In other words, Turkey, with its majority Sunni Muslim population, furnishes a role model for the disenfranchised Sunni majority in Syria (and other Arab spring countries). Not only is Ankara encouraging revolution in Damascus, it is also living proof that Assad's politics of fear are outdated, that Syrians have before them a workable alternative paradigm, and that, after the revolution, the country's secular, Islamist and other sectarian traditions could fairly hope to co-exist peacefully, Turkish-style.

Foreign Policy


Barack Obama's Foreign Policy


November 16, 2011 



Foreign-policy credentials: As president, Obama has taken on a number of major foreign-policy initiatives, including a renewed troop surge in Afghanistan, the negotiation of the New START nuclear arms reduction treaty with Russia, the NATO intervention in Libya, the withdrawal from Iraq, ongoing trade negotiations with China, and of course, the killing of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. 



Overview: Obama is a much different candidate today from the senator who distinguished himself by his opposition to the "dumb war" on his way to the presidency in 2008. Obama has turned out, in many ways, to have pursued a fairly conventional, at times, hawkish foreign policy. He has had some notable successes, such as the bin Laden raid and this year's withdrawal from Iraq -- albeit on a timetable negotiated by his predecessor -- and the successful overthrow of Muammar al-Qaddafi. All the same, "apology tours" and "leading from behind" -- referring to an unfortunate description of Obama's diplomatic strategy by a White House staffer -- have already become buzzwords for Republican candidates. He has also faced heavy criticism on the left for a sometimes inconsistent approach to international law in counterterrorism operations. 




But with a significant economic recovery appearing unlikely and fewer domestic achievements to point to than he might have expected, coupled with the international inexperience of his opponents, Obama may make his foreign-policy wins the centerpiece of his reelection strategy. 




Advisors: Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, National Security Advisor Thomas Donilon. 




On the issues: 




Afghanistan/Pakistan: "We have put al Qaeda on a path to defeat," Obama announced last June, noting that the 33,000 "surge" troops he sent to Afghanistan in 2009 would be out of the country by the summer of 2012. Although a constant barrage of drone strikes and special operations raids have taken a harsh toll on al Qaeda, it may be difficult for Obama to make the case that Afghanistan has achieved stability or that Hamid Karzai's government can stand on its own without U.S. assistance. 




Relations with Pakistan have deteriorated significantly under Obama's tenure, particularly following the bin Laden raid. He has pledged to "constantly evaluate" the relationship between the two countries going forward but says he would be hesitant to cut off aid that could "help the Pakistani people strengthen their own society and their own government." 




Military spending: Backed by his then current defense secretary, Robert Gates, Obama announced last April that the Pentagon will lead a "fundamental review" of U.S. military capabilities in order to cut $400 billion in defense spending over the next 10 years. "We need to not only eliminate waste and improve efficiency and effectiveness, but conduct a fundamental review of America's missions, capabilities, and our role in a changing world," Obama said. Of course, major cuts could come sooner than that if the congressional "supercommittee" fails to reach an agreement on deficit reduction by Nov. 23. 




Immigration/borders: Obama insists that enacting comprehensive immigration reform, which would likely include a path to citizenship for at least some illegal immigrants already in the United States, is still a "top priority," but with little congressional enthusiasm for such a measure, it has been pushed to the back burner for now. Meanwhile, deportations of illegal immigrants are continuing at a record pace, though the administration touts the fact that a higher percentage of those deported have criminal records. 




Obama has substantially increased the number of agents patrolling the U.S.-Mexico border, but has also mocked the fence-building enthusiasm of Republicans, saying they won't be happy until there's a "moat with alligators." 




Israel/Palestine: Obama's engagement in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process has probably been the most frustrating foreign-policy initiative of his presidency and the one on which he is most often criticized by his Republican opponents. Obama continues to support negotiations on a two-state settlement of the conflict, but his best-remembered statement on the topic is controversial: his suggestion that Israel's pre-1967 war borders be taken as a starting point for negotiations, a position fiercely opposed by Israel. More recently, the administration has confirmed that it will veto Palestine's statehood bid in the U.N. Security Council. 




Obama's relationship with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has seemed very strained at times. In a recently overheard conversation he told French President Nicolas Sarkozy, "You're fed up with him? I have to deal with him every day." 




China: Obama has repeatedly criticized China -- most recently at the APEC summit in Honolulu -- for currency policies that he says have a distorting effect on the global economy. The president has made a few cautious statements on China's human rights record but came under criticism for delaying a White House meeting with the Dalai Lama. This year, the administration confirmed a $5.8 billion package of arms sales for Taiwan that provoked a predictable Chinese backlash. 




Foreign aid: In his 2010 address to the U.N. General Assembly, Obama announced an overhaul of U.S. foreign aid policies, which he vowed will place them at the center of U.S. foreign policy. In the speech he called aid a "core pillar of American power." Nonetheless, foreign aid to a number of countries was cut by Congress in the 2012 budget. 




Iran/nukes: Early in his presidency, Obama made several overtures to Iran in an effort to improve relations. Critics say this engagement strategy went too far during the 2009 Green Movement uprising against the reelection of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, when the Obama administration was reluctant to overtly back the protesters. Since then, the administration has instituted a number of new sanctions against Iran that are aimed at halting its nuclear enrichment program. "We are not taking any options off the table. Iran with nuclear weapons would pose a threat not only to the region but also to the United States," Obama said in a recent news conference in Hawaii. 




Trade: In October, Obama signed long-delayed free trade agreements with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea. On his trip to Asia this November, Obama is working to promote a new trans-Pacific free trade agreement. "We're not going to be able to put our folks back to work and grow our economy and expand opportunity unless the Asia-Pacific region is also successful," he said. Obama has indefinitely put on hold a campaign promise to renegotiate NAFTA. 




War on terror/detainees: Obama signed an executive order closing the Guantánamo Bay detention center as one of his first actions as president. The facility remains open, however, largely due to congressional opposition over where to house the remaining prisoners. Obama has put a halt to the "enhanced interrogation techniques" employed by George W. Bush's administration but has enraged some civil liberties advocates by authorizing the extrajudicial killing of alleged al Qaeda terrorist Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen. Obama has also disappointed some liberal supporters by resuming military trials of terrorism suspects at Guantánamo. 




Environment: Despite his stated support for environmental legislation and green energy, there has been little progress on passing major climate-change bills under Obama's watch. Thanks largely to Obama's public intervention, an agreement was reached at the 2009 Copenhagen climate summit, but in failing to impose enforceable emissions targets, the meeting was widely considered a failure. This year, Obama abandoned tough new air-quality rules, adopted early in his administration. 




Russia/reset: One of the centerpieces of Obama's first-term foreign policy was the effort to "reset" relations with Russia. The president successfully negotiated the New START nuclear reduction treaty, though there have been significant disagreements with both Russia and his GOP opponents over the contours of missile defense. Human rights advocates have criticized the president for ignoring the erosion of Russian democracy. Russia has also continued to stymie U.S. efforts to impose tough international sanctions on Iran and Syria. Obama seemed to have made friends with President Dmitry Medvedev, but relations with Russia may only get tougher, with Vladimir Putin's likely return to the Russian presidency. 




Arab Spring: After a slow start, the Obama administration eventually came around to calling for Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to step down, joining the NATO intervention in Libya, and supporting stricter sanctions against Syria. The president has been less outspoken about other Persian Gulf allies, including Bahrain, which hosts a key U.S. naval base. Obama has urged Egypt and Tunisia to "set a strong example through free and fair elections, a vibrant civil society, accountable and effective democratic institutions, and responsible regional leadership." 




Other issues: Although he once described himself as a George H.W. Bush-school realist, in the past year Obama has learned to embrace humanitarian intervention, both in Libya and in central Africa, where military advisors have been sent to aid in the fight against the long-running insurgency by the Lord's Resistance Army. There's speculation that Nigeria may be next. It's a measure of how much things have changed in the last four years that Republicans are now attacking the Democratic president for trying to spread democracy and human rights at the barrel of a gun. 




As the European economic crisis has worsened, Obama has been speaking out more in support of strong measures to protect the common currency. "Ultimately what they are going to need is a firewall that sends a clear signal we stand behind the European project and we stand behind the euro," he said during his recent trip to Australia.

America in the Asian Century


Dominique Moisi





2011-11-15 – At “ground zero” in lower Manhattan, two empty spaces will be filled by water cascades, memorializing in a serene and respectful way the victims of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Next to them, a powerful tower, designed by the architect Daniel Libeskind and nearly completed, rises vigorously into the sky, a symbol of the triumph of life over the forces of death. One word comes to mind to characterize the impression made by this place, the site of an unprecedented crime: resilience.


In a building that houses what will one day be a memorial museum, one can buy a DVD entitled “9/12: From Chaos to Community.” Ground Zero is the architectural and human proof that, despite America’s current economic woes, it would be premature, if not dangerous, to write the country off as a declining power. America has the moral and intellectual resources that it needs in order to rebound.


But what is necessary is not sufficient. In order to reinvent itself, if not to manage its relative international decline, America must proceed toward a rebalancing of its domestic and international priorities. In the immediate aftermath of World War I, a triumphant America withdrew from global responsibility, with tragic consequences for the balance of power in a Europe that was left to face its inner demons alone.


In the aftermath of World War II, by contrast, the US managed successfully to contain Soviet ambitions. Today, unlike in 1945, Americans do not confront an imminent threat. Russia may speak loudly (using its permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council as a megaphone), but it is a greatly reduced rump of the Soviet Union. Likewise, while the nationalism of America’s principal rival, China, has become more assertive lately, the communist regime’s clear priority – indeed, the key to its stability – is domestic economic growth.


Indeed, the only obvious danger that the US faces stems from weapons of mass destruction, which could proliferate or be used by terrorist groups. But confronting this threat does not require a massive military budget or huge deployments of US troops all over the world. America has a much-needed opportunity to refocus on itself – to recover its inner strength without withdrawing from the world. As Richard Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, puts it, America must enter a period of “restoration” of its fundamentals.


American foreign policy starts at home, and that means reining in budget deficits over the long term, reviving economic growth and job creation in the short term, and addressing the country’s deteriorating infrastructure. Indeed, America’s “aged modernity” has become a drag on its competitiveness, as well as an insult to its international image and a risk to the safety of its citizens.


Moreover, imperial fatigue has set in. Recent US history has been characterized by cycles of enthusiasm about foreign engagement. In the mid-1970’s, following the war in Vietnam, America, guided by President Jimmy Carter’s moralizing impulse, opted for “regionalization” of its engagements. But, given that the Soviet threat still existed, this effort came too early (and probably was carried out in the wrong manner).


Today, by contrast, the starting point for a reassessment of American priorities is more economic than ethical. But the reasoning is the same, for it is based on the conviction that more America in the world today implies less costly and confused interventionism tomorrow. That means that US foreign policy itself – defined in recent years by too much attention to the Middle East, and too little to Asia – must embrace a shift in priorities.


Of course, in the midst of today’s ongoing Arab revolutions, America cannot simply ignore the Middle East. Nor must the US give up hope on the Israel-Palestine front, or on its efforts to contain Iran’s nuclear ambitions. But it is in Asia that history is unfolding – and where the US must define its long-term global strategy.


Must the US, as Henry Kissinger suggests in his latest book On China, consider the prospect of a “Pacific Community” that, unlike the Cold War-era Atlantic Community, is not based on common culture and values in the face of a direct threat, but on common interests in an “age of rebalancing of world order”?


America’s resilience may contrast with Europe’s multiple weaknesses. But resilience will not be enough. The US must get back into shape to face tomorrow’s challenges, and that means restoring economic growth, reducing deficits, and improving infrastructure. Paradoxically, only a more confident America can accept a reduced global status, because reconciling oneself to change is always easier once one has taken the steps needed to adjust to it.

The show’s creators, including veteran hitmakers Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk, assembled a large cast of transgender performers, and they’re P-H-E-N-O-M-E-N-A-L. Standouts include Mj Rodriguez as a politically conscious, HIV-positive house mother, and Indya Moore as Angel, a willowy femme whose married boyfriend works for Donald Trump. Truly, the \u003Ci\u003Eentire\u003C/i\u003E cast shines—from the get-go, we’re deeply invested in their victories and struggles. The costumes and sets are perfection, while the alternately intimate and epic storylines shift from entertaining spectacle to gut-wrenching drama without missing a beat. Above all, \u003Ci\u003EPose\u003C/i\u003E tackles dark realities like AIDS, transphobia, and bigotry, but somehow manages to sparkle with light.

Desna (the perfect Niecy Nash) is exploring new relationships, both with her doctor boyfriend and her new (mafia) boss, Zlata (explosive guest star Franka Potente). Virginia is staying devoted to Dean, Desna’s autistic brother. “Quiet Ann” is reeling from her breakup with girlfriend—and detective on their case—Arlene. With a plethora of powerful women and LGBTQ characters, and a no-holds-barred approach to topics from addition and immigration to sex and family, there’s so much more happening here than just seriously fierce nail inspo."},"trackCount":11,"nameSortValue":"Claws, Season 2","id":"1380862406","releaseDate":"2018-06-10","userRating":{"value":4.5,"ratingCount":32},"contentRatingsBySystem":{},"name":"Claws, Season 2","uber":{"backgroundColor":"000000","name":null,"titleTextColor":"fcffff","primaryTextColor":"01c534","masterArt":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features125/v4/55/b3/ca/55b3cad7-8455-8646-cf76-9cdc6ccf3a8e/source/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c9cbcb","textColor2":"02f641","textColor4":"01c534","hasAlpha":false,"textColor1":"fcffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false,"supportsLayeredImage":false},"headerTextColor":null,"primaryTextColorOnBlack":"rgba(45,212,67,1.0)","titleTextColorOnBlack":"rgba(238,241,241,1.0)","description":null},"artistUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/claws/1236255052","formerIds":[],"nameRaw":"Claws, Season 2","seasonNumber":2,"editorialArtwork":{"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features115/v4/dc/f2/bf/dcf2bf22-b0de-71ff-e27f-a08c52a7c2f1/source/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"eed3e5","textColor2":"f3bee5","textColor4":"e59fd1","hasAlpha":true,"textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"af237f","hasP3":false,"supportsLayeredImage":true},"fullscreenBackground":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features118/v4/12/f8/e9/12f8e91d-ff5e-9fef-84e4-e7081efb6f6a/source/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2160,"textColor3":"dcb86d","textColor2":"fbb07b","textColor4":"d99c82","hasAlpha":false,"textColor1":"ffd361","bgColor":"524d9c","hasP3":false,"supportsLayeredImage":false},"contentLogo":{"width":2400,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features118/v4/8d/91/3c/8d913cae-2576-e711-e01c-5619da6f2d99/source/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":390,"textColor3":"cbcbcb","textColor2":"c4c4c4","textColor4":"9d9d9d","hasAlpha":true,"textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false,"supportsLayeredImage":false}},"kind":"tvSeason","copyright":"©2018 Warner Bros.

The show’s creators, including veteran hitmakers Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk, assembled a large cast of transgender performers, and they’re P-H-E-N-O-M-E-N-A-L. Standouts include Mj Rodriguez as a politically conscious, HIV-positive house mother, and Indya Moore as Angel, a willowy femme whose married boyfriend works for Donald Trump. Truly, the \u003Ci\u003Eentire\u003C/i\u003E cast shines—from the get-go, we’re deeply invested in their victories and struggles. The costumes and sets are perfection, while the alternately intimate and epic storylines shift from entertaining spectacle to gut-wrenching drama without missing a beat. Above all, \u003Ci\u003EPose\u003C/i\u003E tackles dark realities like AIDS, transphobia, and bigotry, but somehow manages to sparkle with light.

Desna (the perfect Niecy Nash) is exploring new relationships, both with her doctor boyfriend and her new (mafia) boss, Zlata (explosive guest star Franka Potente). Virginia is staying devoted to Dean, Desna’s autistic brother. “Quiet Ann” is reeling from her breakup with girlfriend—and detective on their case—Arlene. With a plethora of powerful women and LGBTQ characters, and a no-holds-barred approach to topics from addition and immigration to sex and family, there’s so much more happening here than just seriously fierce nail inspo."},"trackCount":11,"nameSortValue":"Claws, Season 2","id":"1380862406","releaseDate":"2018-06-10","userRating":{"value":4.5,"ratingCount":32},"contentRatingsBySystem":{},"name":"Claws, Season 2","uber":{"backgroundColor":"000000","name":null,"titleTextColor":"fcffff","primaryTextColor":"01c534","masterArt":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features125/v4/55/b3/ca/55b3cad7-8455-8646-cf76-9cdc6ccf3a8e/source/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"c9cbcb","textColor2":"02f641","textColor4":"01c534","hasAlpha":false,"textColor1":"fcffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false,"supportsLayeredImage":false},"headerTextColor":null,"primaryTextColorOnBlack":"rgba(45,212,67,1.0)","titleTextColorOnBlack":"rgba(238,241,241,1.0)","description":null},"artistUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/claws/1236255052","formerIds":[],"nameRaw":"Claws, Season 2","seasonNumber":2,"editorialArtwork":{"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features115/v4/dc/f2/bf/dcf2bf22-b0de-71ff-e27f-a08c52a7c2f1/source/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":1080,"textColor3":"eed3e5","textColor2":"f3bee5","textColor4":"e59fd1","hasAlpha":true,"textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"af237f","hasP3":false,"supportsLayeredImage":true},"fullscreenBackground":{"width":4320,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features118/v4/12/f8/e9/12f8e91d-ff5e-9fef-84e4-e7081efb6f6a/source/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":2160,"textColor3":"dcb86d","textColor2":"fbb07b","textColor4":"d99c82","hasAlpha":false,"textColor1":"ffd361","bgColor":"524d9c","hasP3":false,"supportsLayeredImage":false},"contentLogo":{"width":2400,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features118/v4/8d/91/3c/8d913cae-2576-e711-e01c-5619da6f2d99/source/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","height":390,"textColor3":"cbcbcb","textColor2":"c4c4c4","textColor4":"9d9d9d","hasAlpha":true,"textColor1":"ffffff","bgColor":"000000","hasP3":false,"supportsLayeredImage":false}},"kind":"tvSeason","copyright":"©2018 Warner Bros.

"The suit is modeled on the  Marna administration's success- ful suit against Arizona," he said.  But he added that "some of the  key considerations are flipped."

"To the ?xtenttlie-,_  Trump administration s claims  against California would produce  an outcome that would effectively  force states and localities to par- ticipate m immigration enforce- ment; she said,'. there couldhe an  unconstitutional commandeer- ing:"  Professor Spiro said that Cali- fornia may have the upper hand in  the suit's early stages, as the is- sues in it are novel, leaving judges  with substantial discretion.  The Trump administration has  not fared well in federal courts in  California in other cases concern- ing immigration, including ones  challenging President Trump's ef- forts to restrict travel from pre- dominantly Muslim countries and  to rescind a program protecting  some 700,000 young unauthorized  immigrants from deportation.  But the ultimate fate of the suit  will probably rest with the Su- preme Court. In 2012, with what  may have been unwarranted opti- mism Justice Kennedy said he  hoped that conflicts over immi- gration policy would be worked  out through reasoned discussion.  "The national government has  significant power to regulate im- migration," he wrote. "The sound  exercise of national power over  immigration depends on the na- tion's meeting its responsibility to  base its laws on a political will in- formed by searching, thoughtful,  rational civic discourse?'  state custody. A third requires  state officials to inspect some fa- cilities that house people detained  on behalf of the federal govern- ment.  Jennifer Chacon, a law profes- sor at the University of California,  Irvine, said the state laws had  been carefully written to avoid di- rect conflicts with federal immi- gration laws. "I think it is clear  that California deliberately tried  to draft laws that involved core ex- ercises of state police power in a  way that did not run afoul of fed- eral law," she said.  Each state law presents differ- ent issues, and courts may give  varying answers depending on  how directly the state laws con- flict with federal ones. More gen- erally, though, courts will take ac- count of the Supreme Court's deci- sion in the Arizona case, which  called for collaboration rather  than conflict.  "Consultation between federal  and state officials is an important  feature of the immigration sys- tem?' Justice Kennedy wrote in  the court's decision in the Arizona  case.  Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat,  has said that consultation is fine  but that federal officials should  not use California's resources to  pursue undocumented Californi- ans. The federal government, he  added, may do so on its own.  "They are free to use their own  considerable resources to enforce  federal immigration law in Cali- fornia," he said in October in sign- ing one of the challenged laws.  The Supreme Court has said  that the federal government may  not commandeer state resources  to achieve federal objectives. In  his speech on Wednesday, Mr. Ses- sions denied that anything like  that was afoot.  "Contrary to what you might  hear from the lawless open bor- ders radicals," he said, "we are not  asking California, Oakland or any- one else to enforce immigration  laws."  "We are simply asking Califor- nia and other sanctuary jurisdic- tions to stop actively obstructing  federal law enforcement," he add- ed.  But Professor Rodriguez said  Investigating Sexual Misconduct Accusations, Arizona State Suspends a Physicist  By KENNETH CHANG  Arizona State University has  suspended Lawrence M. Krauss,  a prominent theoretical physicist,  while the university investigates  accusations of sexual misconduct  over a decade.  "In an effort to avoid further  disruption to the normal course of  business as the university contin- ues to gather facts about the alle- gations, Krauss has been placed  on paid leave and is prohibited  from being on campus for the du- ration of the review," the univer- sity said in a statement released  on Thesday.  Last month, BuzzFeed reported  that several women have accused  Dr. Krauss of inappropriate be- havior including groping women  and making sexist jokes.  The university said it would not  Order home delivery today.  release any additional details until  its investigation is complete.  Dr. Krauss, a professor in the  university's School of Earth and  Space Exploration, is director of  Arizona State's Origins Project, a  multidisciplinary research effort  to tackle questions about life, the  universe and complex social prob- lems. He gained prominence for  his book, "The Physics of Star  Trek" in 1995. He later became one  of the leaders of the so-called  "skeptics" movement that es- pouses science over religion. He  has also written essays and Op-Ed  articles that were published in  The Times.  Michael Crow, president of Ari- zona State, told The State Press,  an independent student news or- ganization, that the university had  received no complaints of har- assment against Dr. Krauss. The  university started the investiga- tion after being contacted by Buz- zFeed.  Dr. Krauss moved to Arizona  State from Case Western Reserve  University in Ohio in 2008.  Lawrence M. Krauss is direc- tor of Arizona State's Origins  Project, a multidisciplinary re- search effort to tackle ques- tions about life, the universe  and complex social problems.

the suit's early stages, as the is-
sues in it are novel, leaving judges 
with substantial discretion. 
The Trump administration has 
not fared well in federal courts in 
California in other cases concern-
ing immigration, including ones 
challenging President Trump's ef-
forts to restrict travel from pre-
dominantly Muslim countries and 
to rescind a program protecting 
some 700,000 young unauthorized 
immigrants from deportation. 
But the ultimate fate of the suit 
will probably rest with the Su-
preme Court. In 2012, with what 
may have been unwarranted opti-
mism Justice Kennedy said he 
hoped that conflicts over immi-
gration policy would be worked 
out through reasoned discussion. 
"The national government has 
significant power to regulate im-
migration," he wrote. "The sound 
exercise of national power over 
immigration depends on the na-
tion's meeting its responsibility to 
base its laws on a political will in-
formed by searching, thoughtful, 
rational civic discourse?' 
state custody. A third requires 
state officials to inspect some fa-
cilities that house people detained 
on behalf of the federal govern-
ment. 
Jennifer Chacon, a law profes-
sor at the University of California, 
Irvine, said the state laws had 
been carefully written to avoid di-
rect conflicts with federal immi-
gration laws. "I think it is clear 
that California deliberately tried 
to draft laws that involved core ex-
ercises of state police power in a 
way that did not run afoul of fed-
eral law," she said. 
Each state law presents differ-
ent issues, and courts may give 
varying answers depending on 
how directly the state laws con-
flict with federal ones. More gen-
erally, though, courts will take ac-
count of the Supreme Court's deci-
sion in the Arizona case, which 
called for collaboration rather 
than conflict. 
"Consultation between federal 
and state officials is an important 
feature of the immigration sys-
tem?' Justice Kennedy wrote in 
the court's decision in the Arizona 
case. 
Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, 
has said that consultation is fine 
but that federal officials should 
not use California's resources to 
pursue undocumented Californi-
ans. The federal government, he 
added, may do so on its own. 
"They are free to use their own 
considerable resources to enforce 
federal immigration law in Cali-
fornia," he said in October in sign-
ing one of the challenged laws. 
The Supreme Court has said 
that the federal government may 
not commandeer state resources 
to achieve federal objectives. In 
his speech on Wednesday, Mr. Ses-
sions denied that anything like 
that was afoot. 
"Contrary to what you might 
hear from the lawless open bor-
ders radicals," he said, "we are not 
asking California, Oakland or any-
one else to enforce immigration 
laws." 
"We are simply asking Califor-
nia and other sanctuary jurisdic-
tions to stop actively obstructing 
federal law enforcement," he add-
ed. 
But Professor Rodriguez said 
Investigating Sexual Misconduct Accusations, Arizona State Suspends a Physicist 
By KENNETH CHANG 
Arizona State University has 
suspended Lawrence M. Krauss, 
a prominent theoretical physicist, 
while the university investigates 
accusations of sexual misconduct 
over a decade. 
"In an effort to avoid further 
disruption to the normal course of 
business as the university contin-
ues to gather facts about the alle-
gations, Krauss has been placed 
on paid leave and is prohibited 
from being on campus for the du-
ration of the review," the univer-
sity said in a statement released 
on Thesday. 
Last month, BuzzFeed reported 
that several women have accused 
Dr. Krauss of inappropriate be-
havior including groping women 
and making sexist jokes. 
The university said it would not

release any additional details until 
its investigation is complete. 
Dr. Krauss, a professor in the 
university's School of Earth and 
Space Exploration, is director of 
Arizona State's Origins Project, a 
multidisciplinary research effort 
to tackle questions about life, the 
universe and complex social prob-
lems. He gained prominence for 
his book, "The Physics of Star 
Trek" in 1995. He later became one 
of the leaders of the so-called 
"skeptics" movement that es-
pouses science over religion. He 
has also written essays and Op-Ed 
articles that were published in 
The Times. 
Michael Crow, president of Ari-
zona State, told The State Press, 
an independent student news or-
ganization, that the university had 
received no complaints of har-
assment against Dr. Krauss. The 
university started the investiga-
tion after being contacted by Buz-
zFeed. 
Dr. Krauss moved to Arizona 
State from Case Western Reserve 
University in Ohio in 2008.

These conspiracy theories are an aberration and an insult to the memory of the crash victims, including the late 
President himself As a Pole who is at least somewhat aware of the politics and economics of Poland, and a 
journalist who follows world politics and news developments daily, I am severely disappointed at the number of 
people that are flocking to these conspiracy theories, and academics and professionals who propagate such ideas 
should themselves feel ashamed. 
Firstly, there is absolutely no proof that there was any sabotage or subterfuge by either the Russians or the 
Prime Minister's political allies. Such accusations, then, without presenting any credible evidence, are 
slanderous. 
Also, there would be no political or diplomatic capital gained by either of the "accused"... there would be little 
for the Russian government to gain - it would be a huge diplomatic embarrassment for the Russian government 
to be found guilty of essentially assassinating a head of state. Kaczynski was one of the strongest allies of the 
U.S. among European leaders, and even Russia with its assertive diplomatic policies would not risk a complete 
breakdown with the U.S. by killing a close ally. International condemnation would also follow, and the 
President - perhaps even the Prime Minister - would have to resign and wave good-bye to any political career in 
the foreseeable future. Yes, "even in Russia." 
Similarly, for the Prime Minister's party, if he were actually complicit in the crash, that would mean he - or his 
allies - committed a coup d'etat. Also, there will be early presidential elections in June, which might actually go 
in favor of the President's party because of a sympathy vote. The "acting" Presidency is in the hands of his party 
for only two months... so, again, the Prime Minister and his allies have nothing to gain and potentially 
everything to lose in the June vote. 
Conspiracy-monging cheapens a national tragedy 
Political profit or loss questions aside, however, the conspiracy-monging seems to be taken as a way to discover 
who's responsible for the tragedy and thus somehow bring them justice. However, it is not a healthy way to deal 
with the tragedy. It is not conducive to national or personal healing. Furthermore, it disgraces and taints the 
memory of those who died. 
It only cheapens the tragedy and, sadly, may foreshadow what's to come in the coming presidential campaign - 
the tragedy may be used by certain groups or individuals to propagate their own agenda and assume the 
presidency. 
It is not so different than what has been going on in the U.S., with the "birthers" claiming Barack Obama is not 
legally the President because he is not actually a citizen, or even natural-born citizen. Not as morbid, of course, 
but still, in my honest opinion, ridiculous. 
Baseless, nonsensical conspiracies simply destroys the abiltiy of the nation and people of Poland to move on 
and honor the memory of those lost, and cheapens the tragedy that has been felt by Poles as far away as Chicago 
as well, and commented on with deep sorrow and respect by U.S. politicians from Mayor Daley to President 
Obama himself

<h5>Strive Masiyiwa’s next challenge Respected by world leaders ... Strive Masiyiwa (right) with Bill Clinton and his daughter NEW ZIMBABWE 19-08-2014 SPEAKING at a microfinance symposium in Turin, Italy, recently, Econet Wireless founder Strive Masiyiwa recalled the ruling by the judge who gave him a licence in 1998 saying that “70 percent of people in the country had never heard a telephone ring” The licence was granted after a costly five-year legal battle against the government. According to the UK-based Guardian newspaper Masiyiwa told the Turin gathering that “today, 75 percent of people [in Zimbabwe] have a cell phone; and I want 75 percent of the people in Africa to have a bank account … on a mobile phone.” Not only that, Econet Wireless has since grown into a diversified technology and financial services group with operations in 17 countries including Botswana, Lesotho, Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa and New Zealand. Another problem, and opportunity, arose when the government ditched the Zimbabwe dollar in 2009 for more stable foreign currencies. The transacting public, having struggled with huge amounts of worthless cash in the hyperinflation years, welcomed the decision. But with the country’s productive and export sectors all but collapsed, there just wasn’t enough of the foreign currencies in circulation. “If you wanted to buy a packet of sweets for your child, you couldn’t get change,” said Masiyiwa. Econet intervened with a mobile payments system which has set Zimbabwe on course to become Africa’s first cashless economy. “Today 43 percent of the GDP moves through Econet Wireless,” said the telecoms mogul. Explained Econet’s chief executive, Douglas Mboweni , recently said: “We do not expect anyone to still be using paper money in a year’s time. It will be just like Europe or America, where you no longer see people carrying bundles of cash.” Masiyiwa told the Guardian that his next challenge is to create a product that allows people who are informally employed, such as smallholder farmers and casual workers, to access credit. “In Africa 70 percent of people are informally employed,” he says. “The big frontier for us is to create platforms where those people can access credit.” There is little risk that they will get into unmanageable debt because the banks won’t extend excessive credit, calling the system “self-regulating”. “We’re trying to build up a savings culture where people are encouraged to save, even if they only have a dollar – for children’s school fees, for transport, for the doctor.

Strive Masiyiwa’s next challenge
Respected by world leaders ... Strive Masiyiwa (right) with Bill Clinton and his
daughter
NEW ZIMBABWE 19-08-2014
SPEAKING at a microfinance symposium in Turin, Italy, recently, Econet Wireless founder
Strive Masiyiwa recalled the ruling by the judge who gave him a licence in 1998 saying that
“70 percent of people in the country had never heard a telephone ring”
The licence was granted after a costly five-year legal battle against the government.
According to the UK-based Guardian newspaper Masiyiwa told the Turin gathering that
“today, 75 percent of people [in Zimbabwe] have a cell phone; and I want 75 percent of the
people in Africa to have a bank account … on a mobile phone.” Not only that, Econet
Wireless has since grown into a diversified technology and financial services group with
operations in 17 countries including Botswana, Lesotho, Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa and
New Zealand.
Another problem, and opportunity, arose when the government ditched the Zimbabwe dollar
in 2009 for more stable foreign currencies. The transacting public, having struggled with
huge amounts of worthless cash in the hyperinflation years, welcomed the decision. But with
the country’s productive and export sectors all but collapsed, there just wasn’t enough of the
foreign currencies in circulation.
“If you wanted to buy a packet of sweets for your child, you couldn’t get change,” said
Masiyiwa. Econet intervened with a mobile payments system which has set Zimbabwe on
course to become Africa’s first cashless economy. “Today 43 percent of the GDP moves
through Econet Wireless,” said the telecoms mogul. Explained Econet’s chief executive,
Douglas Mboweni , recently said: “We do not expect anyone to still be using paper money in
a year’s time. It will be just like Europe or America, where you no longer see people carrying
bundles of cash.”
Masiyiwa told the Guardian that his next challenge is to create a product that allows people
who are informally employed, such as smallholder farmers and casual workers, to access
credit. “In Africa 70 percent of people are informally employed,” he says. “The big frontier for
us is to create platforms where those people can access credit.” There is little risk that they
will get into unmanageable debt because the banks won’t extend excessive credit, calling
the system “self-regulating”.
“We’re trying to build up a savings culture where people are encouraged to save, even if
they only have a dollar – for children’s school fees, for transport, for the doctor. A savings
and credit infrastructure builds resilience.” However, in order to reach the unbanked,
financial institutions – and telecommunications companies – must design services that are
practical, simple and affordable. “I’ve got a customer who has a dollar in his pocket and has
got to decide to have some lunch, call his cousin or go to the doctor,” he said.
“We have to develop services with sensitivity to the fact that in Africa our customers don’t
have the same disposable income as in New Zealand, for example.” It would however, be a
mistake to assume the poorest behave differently to other customers. “Their behaviour and
aspirations are no different from those who have higher incomes,” cautioned Masiyiwa.
“They want to use Facebook. They want to use WhatsApp. We have to find ways for them to
access those things with their very low income.”

NYT   Building Boom in Gaza’s Ruins Belies Misery That Remains   Ethan Bronner      June 25, 2011 -- GAZA — Two luxury hotels are opening in Gaza this month. Thousands of new cars are plying the roads. A second shopping mall — with escalators imported from Israel — will open next month. Hundreds of homes and two dozen schools are about to go up. A Hamas-run farm where Jewish settlements once stood is producing enough fruit that Israeli imports are tapering off.    As pro-Palestinian activists prepare to set sail aboard a flotilla aimed at maintaining an international spotlight on Gaza and pressure on Israel, this isolated Palestinian coastal enclave is experiencing its first real period of economic growth since the siege they are protesting began in 2007.    “Things are better than a year ago,” said Jamal El-Khoudary, chairman of the board of the Islamic University, who has led Gaza’s Popular Committee Against the Siege. “The siege on goods is now 60 to 70 percent over.”    Ala al-Rafati, the economy minister for Hamas, the militant group that governs Gaza, said in an interview that nearly 1,000 factories are operating here, and he estimated unemployment at no more than 25 percent after a sharp drop in jobless levels in the first quarter of this year. “Yesterday alone, the Gaza municipality launched 12 projects for paving roads, digging wells and making gardens,” he said.    So is that the news from Gaza in mid-2011? Yes, but so is this: Thousands of homes that were destroyed in the Israeli antirocket invasion two and a half years ago have not been rebuilt. Hospitals have canceled elective surgery for lack of supplies. Electricity remains maddeningly irregular. The much-publicized opening of the Egyptian border has fizzled, so people remain trapped here. The number of residents living on less than $1.60 a day has tripled in four years. Three-quarters of the population rely on food aid.    Areas with as contested a history as this one can choose among anniversaries to commemorate. It has been four years since Hamas took over, prompting Israel and Egypt to impose a blockade on people and most goods. It is a year since a Turkish flotilla challenged the siege and Israeli commandos killed nine activists aboard the ships, leading to international outrage and an easing of conditions. And it is five years since an Israeli soldier, Staff Sgt. Gilad Shalit, was abducted and held in captivity without even visits from the Red Cross.    In assessing the condition of the 1.6 million people who live in Gaza, there are issues of where to draw the baseline and — often — what motivates the discussion. It has never been among the world’s poorest places. There is near universal literacy and relatively low infant mortality, and health conditions remain better than across much of the developing world.    “We have 100 percent vaccination; no polio, measles, diphtheria or AIDS,” said Mahmoud Daher, a World Health Organization official here. “We’ve never had a cholera outbreak.”    The Israeli government and its defenders use such data to portray Gaza as doing just fine and Israeli policy as humane and appropriate: no flotillas need set sail.    Israel’s critics say the fact that the conditions in Gaza do not rival the problems in sub-Saharan Africa only makes the political and human rights crisis here all the more tragic — and solvable. Israel, they note, still controls access to sea, air and most land routes, and its security policies have consciously strangled development opportunities for an educated and potentially high-achieving population that is trapped with no horizon. Pressure needs to be maintained to end the siege entirely, they say, and talk of improvement is counterproductive.    The recent changes stem from a combination of Israeli policy shifts and the chaos in Egypt. The new Egyptian border policy has made little difference, but Egypt’s revolution and its reduced policing in the Sinai have had a profound effect.    For the past year, Israel has allowed most everything into Gaza but cement, steel and other construction material — other than for internationally supervised projects — because they are worried that such supplies can be used by Hamas for bunkers and bombs. A number of international projects are proceeding, but there is an urgent need for housing, street paving, schools, factories and public works projects, all under Hamas or the private sector, and Israel’s policy bans access to the goods to move those forward.    So in recent months, tunnels under the southern border that were used to bring in consumer goods have become almost fully devoted to smuggling in building materials.    Sacks of cement and piles of gravel, Turkish in origin and bought legally in Egypt, are smuggled through the hundreds of tunnels in double shifts, day and night, totaling some 3,000 tons a day. Since the overthrow of President Hosni Mubarak, the Egyptian security authorities no longer stop the smugglers. Streets are being paved and buildings constructed.    “Mubarak was crushing us before,” said Mahmoud Mohammad, a subcontractor whose 10-man crew in Gaza City was unloading steel bars that were carried through the tunnels and were destined for a new restaurant. “Last year we were sitting at home. The contractor I work for has three major projects going.”    Nearby, Amer Selmi was supervising the building of a three-story, $2 million wedding hall. Most of his materials come from the tunnels.    Karim Gharbawi is an architect and building designer with 10 projects under way, all of them eight- and nine-story residential properties. He said there were some 130 engineering and design firms in Gaza. Two years ago, none were working. Today, he said, all of them are.    Another result of the regional changes is the many new cars here. Israel allows in 20 a week, but that does not meet the need. Hundreds of BMWs, pickup trucks and other vehicles have arrived in recent months from Libya, driven through Egypt and sold via the unmonitored tunnels. Dozens of white Kia Sportage models, ubiquitous on the street, are widely thought to have come from the same dealership in Benghazi, Libya, that was looted after the uprising there began.    Hamas’s control of Gaza appears firmer than ever, and the looser tunnel patrols in Egypt mean greater access to weapons as well. But opinion surveys show that its more secular rival, Fatah, is more popular. That may explain why an attempt at political unity with Fatah is moving slowly: the Hamas leaders here are likely to lose their jobs. The hospital supply crisis is a direct result of tensions with Fatah in the West Bank, which has kept the supplies from being shipped here.    Efforts by fringe Islamist groups to challenge Hamas have had little effect. And it has been a year since the government unsuccessfully sought to impose tighter religious restrictions by banning women from smoking water pipes in public. On a recent afternoon in the new Carino’s restaurant — with billiards, enormous flat-screen televisions, buttery-soft chairs — women without head coverings were smoking freely.    But such places and people represent a wafer-thin slice of Gazan society, and focusing on them distorts the broader and grimmer picture.

Herald Tribune   Buying Into Palestinian Statehood   Yossi Alpher, Colette Avital, Shlomo Gazit, and Mark Heller      June 24, 2011— Instead of wasting time and energy trying to revive a moribund Israeli-Palestinian peace process, the United States and European Union should take another look at the Palestinian initiative to seek U.N. recognition in September. What is described in some quarters as a recipe for new strife and confrontation can actually be leveraged into a win-win situation for Israelis, Palestinians and the world.    The Palestinians under Mahmoud Abbas want the United Nations to grant them a sovereign state based on the 1967 boundaries with East Jerusalem as its capital. That’s all. It is not asking the U.N. to solve the refugee /right-of-return issue or to determine who owns the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. It is opting to convert an intractable conflict between a state and a liberation movement into a state-to-state conflict with manageable parameters.    Why not offer the Palestinians what they want, but add elements that could render the resolution acceptable to a majority of Israelis?    Israel wants acceptance as a Jewish state with its recognized capital in Jerusalem. It needs assurances regarding the nature and priorities of future negotiations, with the truly intractable issues postponed to a later phase. It needs solid security arrangements, understandings regarding Hamas rule in Gaza, and a viable incentive from an Arab world that has long offered to reward it for moving forward with the Palestinians.    Here are the components of a possible “win-win” U.N. resolution regarding Palestinian statehood:    • Reaffirm support for the resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict on the basis of two states for two peoples and the right of the Jewish and Palestinian peoples to self-determination, without prejudice to the rights of all citizens and minority groups. Recall, in this context, U.N. General Assembly resolution 181 of 1947 that called for the establishment of a Jewish state and an Arab state.    • Acknowledge institutional and security reform, economic development and state-building efforts — especially in the West Bank, under the leadership of President Abbas and Prime Minister Salam Fayyad, which have helped lay the foundations for Palestinian statehood — and endorse the position articulated by the World Bank and the United Nations that the Palestinian Authority is “well positioned for the establishment of a state at any point in the near future.”    • Accordingly, support the establishment of an independent and sovereign Palestinian state on the basis of the 1967 lines with its capital in East Jerusalem in parallel with Israel’s recognized capital in West Jerusalem, and with mutually agreed territorial swaps and modifications, subject to negotiation — a state that will live side by side with Israel in peace and security.    • Recognize that extending the authority of a Palestinian state to the Gaza Strip will depend on effective control there by a legitimate Palestinian government that exercises authority in the West Bank, is committed to the Quartet principles and the Arab Peace Initiative and respects the commitments of the Palestine Liberation Organization.    • Call for both states to engage in good faith negotiations on the basis of this and previous relevant resolutions and agreements in order to resolve all outstanding issues between them, beginning with the issues of borders, settlements, water and security arrangements. Specifically, security arrangements — including multi-layered international, regional and bilateral guarantees — should confront and neutralize threats and enable the phased withdrawal of Israeli forces from a demilitarized Palestinian state with an effective internal security force and without compromising Israeli security.    • Note the importance of the Arab Peace Initiative, endorsed by the Arab League in 2002, and call for regional states to assist in creating an atmosphere conducive to negotiation and agreement, including by intensifying efforts to advance coexistence and normalization of relations between Arab League members and Israel.    A creative and courageous approach to leveraging the Palestinian initiative will not end the conflict. But it could make it far more manageable.

Khouri      June 25, 2011 -- My pleasure at speaking this week in Ottawa at a gathering at the International Development Research Center of Canada was compounded by the very thoughtful questions and comments that members of the audience offered.   The audience raised new questions in my mind about what is likely or possibly may occur in the Arab region, as the current citizen revolt moves into its seventh month. The issues they raised revolved around the reality that there is no certain outcome to the developments in assorted Arab countries. While I and many other Arab citizens feel that the wave of democratic transformations will continue to wash across most of the region, sweeping away old and young autocrats and opening the door to new democracies, this is by no means certain.   Economic pressures, for one, could easily create such immense stresses on families that many Arabs who celebrated the Tunisian and Egyptian regime changes may welcome the return of strongmen who restrict citizens’ powers but provide more jobs. I doubt this will happen, but we can never rule it out. The demands of children’s stomachs crying out for food that many families cannot afford to buy are immensely powerful drivers of political behavior.   Another threat that some audience members raised was related to the potential break-up of some countries into smaller units that could be more easily controlled by regional or foreign powers. The first Arab revolt against the Ottomans around a century ago occurred simultaneously with the Sykes-Picot accord, by which France and Great Britain carved up the Arab east into smaller units that were put under the rule of locally chosen leaders whom the Europeans knew they could trust. It is possible that the current transformations might result in security vacuums that local parties or foreign powers could exploit to fragment some Arab states into smaller units that would then be more reliant on foreign support or protection.   Sudan has already split into northern and southern states, while Yemen, Iraq and possibly a few others are similarly susceptible to subdivision into smaller statelets. This raises difficult issues about the inviolability of the current Arab borders that the retreating Europeans created last century. I thought the secession of South Sudan was a perfectly acceptable development, if it reflected the will of the people of the south, and was not imposed on them. The operative principle in such possible developments is whether change reflects the consent of the governed and represents the will of the majority, while protecting the rights of minorities. If Yemenis decide to split again into two or even three states, and this reflects the free will of the Yemeni people, they should be allowed to do so without external interference.   There is nothing sacred or permanent about the borders of any country, especially Arab countries that were mostly created by the handiwork of European colonial officers. Countries evolve and sometimes change shape as a routine historical process. If some Arabs decide they are uncomfortable with their existing state boundaries and they wish to break away and form a separate country, that should always be an option. After all, the world mostly rejoiced when the former Soviet Union and its empire collapsed and some of its constituent republics fragmented into smaller units, notably Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia.   We should be prepared to deal with the specter of existing Arab countries that reconfigure their frontiers and populations while they are reconfiguring their political governance systems.   Another point that was raised in several different forms related to how the current Arab revolt would affect relations with major Western countries, especially since many Western powers actively supported the Arab autocrats who are now being challenged and, in some cases, removed from office. Would newly liberated Arab citizenries seek revenge against Western powers?   My impression is that this will depend on the new policies that these Western powers adopt, rather than on what they did in the past. Most Arabs are critical of Western powers because they unquestioningly back Israel or support Arab autocrats. Should those policies be moderated and replaced by more even-handed postures toward the Middle East, newly liberated Arab citizens would probably be too busy building their new countries to allow themselves to be distracted by lingering resentments from the past.   What is the single most important development that could trigger regime change in some countries now facing domestic challenges and unrest, one person asked? Three reasons come to mind: economic collapse could do so; or key figures in the military and security agencies could stop protecting the regime; or strategically placed commercial, tribal, sectarian and business leaders in society could decide that the current course was disastrous and, in consequence, could bring about the fall of the regime.       Article 4.   Guardian   Why Israel is wrong about Iran   Meir Javedanfar       25 June 2011 -- Israel's former intelligence chief, Meir Dagan, has been subjected to a firestorm of criticism – from the Israeli government as well as sections of the media – since he stated that attacking Iran's nuclear installations would be "a stupid idea".   So strong has been the reaction that the prime minister's office even asked him to return his diplomatic passport. What seems to be bothering some Israelis, including Ari Shavit, the respected Haaretz journalist, is that Dagan has now "made the Iranians think they can continue galloping to the bomb because they are not in any real danger".  This claim, though, is a clear example of where some in Israel are getting it wrong with regard to Iran and what the Iranian leadership perceives as serious threats.  Israel has to realise that the Tehran regime is more petrified by what is happening to its economy and among its own population than by the possibility of a military attack from Israel. When it comes to using violence, this regime has had 32 years of experience. It can cope. However, the regime is so frightened of its own population that it breaks up silent demonstrations. It panicked when the shooting of Neda Agha Soltan was filmed and broadcast to the world. It even went as far as to temporarily ban books by Paulo Coelho – simply because his editor in Iran, Arash Hejazi, was seen trying to save Neda's life.   Dagan could be wrong in his assessment but, even if he is right, it does not mean that cessation of a military threat from Israel would induce the Iranian government to "gallop ahead" towards the bomb without any concern.   The biggest reason why Iran's supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, has agreed to talks during the last few years is not the fear of a military attack by Israel. The biggest reason is that he is worried about his country's economy, which is far more crucial to the regime's survival than the nuclear programme. The Islamic regime in Iran has not and will not live on its nuclear programme. It lives on its economy.  Khamenei is worried that if he doesn't negotiate, the west will find it easier to justify isolating his country. This, in turn, will make it easier to gain international approval for tough economic sanctions.  With so much legitimacy lost domestically after Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's controversial election in 2009, Khamenei has even more reason to worry about the impact that sanctions could have on the survival of his regime. This is the main reason why he is negotiating and will continue to do so. This is also why he will be careful, as he was before Dagan's statement, in the way he approaches his nuclear programme.  One also has to ask: which is the bigger reason why the international community is becoming more united against Iran's nuclear programme? Its distaste and concern for Khamanei's desire to have access to a bomb (which is becoming more apparent from clause 35 of the most recent IAEA report), or threats by Israel to attack Iran's nuclear installations? After recent revelations, such as the secret enrichment site near Qom, the former is more true.  To deal with such a regime and to confront its controversial nuclear programme, instead of constantly relying on military threats, Israel's leaders would be better advised to study Coelho's masterpiece, The Alchemist, and page 121 in particular:    "When you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it."   Israel is no longer alone in its belief that Iran wants to build a bomb. Judging by the support for sanctions, the UN and especially its security council members are more on the side of Israel than Iran. This includes countries such as South Korea that have adopted unilateral sanctions against Iran.  In its bid to stop Iran's nuclear programme Israel should help itself and the international community. The most potent way would be by improving relations with the Islamic world, especially the PLO and Turkey. Israel had good relations with them before. It can do so again.   Fortunately for Israel, and unfortunately for Khamenei, Israel even has the option to hurt the regime on its very own streets.   That option is the cessation of verbal military threats against Iran. Cessation of military threats from Israel will make it much harder for the regime to divert the public's attention away from its falling popularity and serious domestic problems. Silence from Israel will make Iran's leaders more worried, as it will rob Khamenei from an important tool which has helped him, and at a crucial time when the regime is hemorrhaging legitimacy and popularity at an unprecedented rate. The damage such an endeavour will cause is worth the inconvenience of Israeli politicians having to bite their tongues.   Cessation of verbal threats will also prevent significant future damage being caused to Israel's deterrence posture if, at the end of the day, it decides to not to attack Iran's nuclear installations.   Coelho once said:    "Be careful. You can hurt with your words, but you can also hurt with your silence."   The words of a wise man.

The Financial Time   Global oil supplies are healthier than they seem    Ian Bremmer      June 24, 2011 -- Many of the world’s oil consuming nations, led by the US, shocked oil markets this week as the International Energy Agency agreed to release 60m barrels of oil from strategic reserves over the coming month. The move was intended to offset price pressures brought about by Libya’s supply cut and comes in response to Opecs recent inability to formally endorse new supply increases. The IEA action is also an example of growing concern over higher oil prices in Washington, where the White House is managing political fallout from high gasoline prices as next year’s presidential elections loom just over the horizon.   Yet, a year from now, we’re likely to look back on this moment and find that fears for supply have diminished. There are three reasons.   First, the most substantial fallout from the Arab world’s recent upheaval is behind us. Syria’s Bashar al-Assad continues to  fight for survival and Yemen continues to flirt with failed-state status, but the Gulf’s major oil-producing states are quite stable. So are other major producers. Even in Iran, with its leaders infighting, the green revolution has moved off the streets for now. While there are plenty of long-term structural challenges for many major economies ﻿– just ask China – for the moment there are no more Libyas left to explode. IEA action and the ongoing Saudi supply increases will neutralise what remains of the oil price’s political risk premium.   Second, big additional supply is coming, and it’s not all priced in. Offshore Brazil and Canadian oil sands are no longer new stories, but their collective impact has not yet been fully felt and is often undervalued. Iraq still draws undue scepticism but production there is showing serious promise. The country could add up to 300,000 barrels this year, with more contracts, more exploration and more drilling already in the works. Barring an unlikely and total implosion of the government, it is hard to see production slowing down this decade. The same is true for “tight oil” coming from unconventional sources. We are seeing this begin to play out in North American fields such as the Bakken in North Dakota. As technology and investment are dispersed over the coming year, oil supply should positively surprise.   Third, Saudi supply increases are not dependant on Opec. The country’s oil minister Ali Naimi left the cartel’s Vienna meeting earlier this month with complaints that the organisation had just endured one of its most contentious and least productive gatherings in many years. But that is only because the major oil players were not prepared to pretend that there was agreement on output quotas. With Iran chairing the meeting, an annoyed Venezuela in attendance and an embattled Libya looking on, it was much harder to get the group to put aside their differences and smile for the cameras. The Saudis have the most influence on price-moving output decisions and they increased production just as they had planned before the meeting proved so difficult. Economically stressed oil producers such as Iran and Venezuela always want higher oil prices. But the Saudis and other Gulf Co-operation Council producers maintain a longer-term moderating outlook and they are the ones with the spare capacity to make the difference.   Add that to your favourite economist’s projection on the softness of the global economy, and we may soon be asking whether or not this latest IEA move was worth it.

Newsweek   Robert Gates: America is losing its grip   John Barry and Tara McKelvey      27 June -- Aboard the Pentagon jet on his last foreign trip as secretary of defense, Robert Gates takes a moment to peer across the American horizon--and the view is dire: the U.S. is in danger of losing its supremacy on the global stage, he says.   "I've spent my entire adult life with the United States as a superpower, and one that had no compunction about spending what it took to sustain that position," he tells NEWSWEEK, seated in the strategic communications center of the Boeing E-4B. "It didn't have to look over its shoulder because our economy was so strong. This is a different time."  A pause.  "To tell you the truth, that's one of the many reasons it's time for me to retire, because frankly I can't imagine being part of a nation, part of a government ... that's being forced to dramatically scale back our engagement with the rest of the world."  Such a statement--rather astonishing for the leader of the world's preeminent fighting force--may open the administration to charges of not believing in American exceptionalism, an opening the GOP is already trying to exploit. But these days Gates is less worried about political crossfire and more focused on the legacy of his own tenure, which bridged the presidencies of George W. Bush and Barack Obama. He is determined to define his own legacy as Pentagon boss, and eager to push back against one of the more vocal criticisms of his tenure: the belief among many liberals and some conservative budget hawks that in a time of deep indebtedness, he hasn't been willing to chop enough of a defense budget bloated by a decade of war.  Don't expect him to apologize. In Gates's mind, it's other political leaders with less experience who are confused.   "Congress is all over the place," Gates says at one point. "And the Republicans are a perfect example. I mean, you've got the budget hawks and then you've got the defense hawks within the same party. And so I think there is no consensus on a role in the world."   In some ways, the first part of his tenure was easier. During the Bush years, money was never an issue. By contrast, Obama faced a harsh economic reality, and Gates tried to get in front of the issue by shrinking the Pentagon budget. But his cuts satisfied neither hawks nor doves nor the White House. This spring, when Obama announced a $400 billion reduction in defense spending, Gates got just 24 hours' notice.  Gates, who'll be succeeded by CIA chief Leon Panetta, wins bipartisan accolades for restoring morale at the Pentagon and, more important, repairing relations with Congress, which had grown distrustful of the Defense Department under Rumsfeld.   Bridging two administrations, Gates gets credit for stabilizing Iraq, though the key decisions that led to success--a surge of troops and the appointment of Gen. David Petraeus to oversee the strategy--predated his arrival.   Petraeus says Gates knew that his real contribution was to buy time in Washington for the strategy to succeed. " 'Your battle space is Iraq. My battle space is Washington,' " Petraeus recalls Gates telling him.  Gates concedes he was sometimes on the wrong side of an issue. For instance, he was gun-shy about using ground troops to kill Osama bin Laden, arguing that Obama should opt for an airstrike instead. Gates hesitated because he feared a repeat of the bungled 1980 attempt to free American hostages in Iran that killed eight U.S. servicemen. "I was very explicit with the president in one of the discussions," Gates acknowledges. "I said: 'Mr. President, I want truth in lending. Because of experience, I may be too cautious, you know.'?"   Obama overruled Gates, siding with those who wanted to deploy the elite Navy SEALs, securing the biggest victory in the 10-year war on terror.  Rather than a transformational figure, a more accurate description for Gates may be "steady hand on the wheel," says the Foreign Policy Research Institute's Michael Noonan.   "I don't think [Gates's] accomplishments merit the sky-high reputation that he enjoys as he leaves office," former senior CIA analyst Paul Pillar says. "Gates has long had a knack for nurturing his own reputation."   Pillar recalls that Gates during his CIA days was "always saying, 'I'm going to whip this organization into shape.' Anything good that happens, it's because 'I'm head of the organization.' Anything bad can be attributed to 'institutional resistance.'"   When Gates took over the Pentagon in December 2006, he quickly demonstrated the diplomatic and political acumen he had acquired as he worked his way up through the intelligence community as the first career officer to become CIA director.   Take, for instance, his decision to court Hillary Clinton when she took over as secretary of state in 2009. One of the few senior Bush holdovers in the new Obama administration, Gates was keenly aware of the tensions between the State and Defense departments built up during the war in Iraq. He invited Clinton to his Pentagon office, and the two ate lunch at a table that belonged to Confederate President Jefferson Davis back when he was U.S. secretary of war.   "I just told her, based on my experience, that how well the administration worked would depend a lot on how well she and I got along together," Gates recalls. "If we got along, the message would go to the entire bureaucracy--not just our own bureaucracies but the rest of government as well. She totally understood."   Gates made a calculated--and more public--courtship of her entire agency. "I read in the press, and therefore it must be true, that no secretary of defense had ever been quoted as arguing for a bigger budget for State," Gates boasts now.  The strategy worked. Clinton and Gates try to get together privatelyonce a week to work out differences between their departments, and working with a younger generation, the two have bonded.   "Hillary and I call ourselves the Old Folks Caucus," Gates quips. "And I must say, it's the first time in my life I've worked for a president who was 20 years younger than I was."   Gates's tenure had difficult moments, too. Three years ago, he rejected requests from Gen. David McKiernan, his then top commander in Afghanistan, for more troops, believing there weren't enough resources. Gates stayed the course until 2009, when he argued for the troop surge that now appears to have stalled the insurgency.   Gates acknowledges a historical similarity to the Vietnam War. "There is one parallel that I think is appropriate, and that is we came to the right strategy and the right resources very late in the game," Gates says. "President Obama, I think, got the right strategy and the right resources for Afghanistan--but eight years in."   In Afghanistan, Gates leaves behind a difficult, unfinished piece of business: to convince Congress and war-weary Americans that any major U.S. withdrawal should be delayed by a year--a deferment sought by military commanders on the ground. Likewise, Gates won't be around for what may be the most delicate aspect of the exit strategy--trying to broker reconciliation between the Taliban and the Afghan ruling parties aligned with the U.S.   "I'm not saying it'll all be settled," says Gates. "I'm just saying you could begin a serious dialogue by the end of the year." But, he concedes, "asking for another year is hard."                Article 7.   The National Interest    The Good Autocrat   Robert D. Kaplan      June 21, 2011 -- IN HIS extended essay, On Liberty, published in 1859, the English philosopher John Stuart Mill famously declares, “That the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others.” Mill’s irreducible refutation of tyranny leads him to—I have always felt—one of the most moving passages in literature, in which he extols the moral virtues of Marcus Aurelius, only to register the Roman’s supreme flaw. Mill writes:   If ever any one, possessed of power, had grounds for thinking himself the best and most enlightened among his contemporaries, it was the Emperor Marcus Aurelius. Absolute monarch of the whole civilized world, he preserved through life not only the most unblemished justice, but what was less to be expected from his Stoical breeding, the tenderest heart. The few failings which are attributed to him, were all on the side of indulgence: while his writings, the highest ethical product of the ancient mind, differ scarcely perceptibly, if they differ at all, from the most characteristic teachings of Christ.  And yet, as Mill laments, this “unfettered intellect,” this exemplar of humanism by second-century-AD standards, persecuted Christians. As deplorable a state as society was in at the time (wars, internal revolts, cruelty in all its manifestations), Marcus Aurelius assumed that what held it together and kept it from getting worse was the acceptance of the existing divinities, which the adherents of Christianity threatened to dissolve. He simply could not foresee a world knit together by new and better ties. “No Christian,” Mill writes, “more firmly believes that Atheism is false, and tends to the dissolution of society, than Marcus Aurelius believed the same things of Christianity.”   If even such a ruler as Marcus Aurelius could be so monumentally wrong, then no dictator, it would seem, no matter how benevolent, could ever ultimately be trusted in his judgment. It follows, therefore, that the persecution of an idea or ideals for the sake of the existing order can rarely be justified, since the existing order is itself suspect. And, pace Mill, if we can never know for certain if authority is in the right, even as anarchy must be averted, the only recourse for society is to be able to choose and regularly replace its forever-imperfect leaders.  But there is a catch. As Mill admits earlier in his essay,   Liberty, as a principle, has no application to any state of things anterior to the time when mankind have become capable of being improved by free and equal discussion. Until then, there is nothing . . . but implicit obedience to an Akbar or a Charlemagne, if they are so fortunate as to find one.   Indeed, Mill knows that authority has first to be created before we can go about limiting it. For without authority, however dictatorial, there is a fearful void, as we all know too well from Iraq in 2006 and 2007. In fact, no greater proponent of individual liberty than Isaiah Berlin himself observes in his introduction to Four Essays on Liberty that, “Men who live in conditions where there is not sufficient food, warmth, shelter, and the minimum degree of security can scarcely be expected to concern themselves with freedom of contract or of the press.” In “Two Concepts of Liberty,” Berlin allows that “First things come first: there are situations . . . in which boots are superior to the works of Shakespeare, individual freedom is not everyone’s primary need.” Further complicating matters, Berlin notes that “there is no necessary connection between individual liberty and democratic rule.” There might be a despot “who leaves his subjects a wide area of liberty” but cares “little for order, or virtue, or knowledge.” Clearly, just as there are good and bad popularly elected leaders, there are good and bad autocrats.  THE SIGNAL fact of the Arab world at the beginning of this year of democratic revolution was that, for the most part, it encompassed few of these subtleties and apparent contradictions. Middle Eastern societies had long since moved beyond basic needs of food and security to the point where individual freedom could easily be contemplated. After all, over the past half century, Arabs from the Maghreb to the Persian Gulf experienced epochal social, economic, technological and demographic transformation: it was only the politics that lagged behind. And while good autocrats there were, the reigning model was sterile and decadent national-security regimes, deeply corrupt and with sultanic tendencies. These leaders sought to perpetuate their rule through offspring: sons who had not risen through the military or other bureaucracies, and thus had no legitimacy. Marcus Aurelius was one thing; Tunisia’s Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, Egypt’s Hosni Mubarak and Syria’s Bashar al-Assad, quite another. Certainly, the Arab Spring has proved much: that there is no otherness to Arab civilization, that Arabs yearn for universal values just as members of other societies do. But as to difficult questions regarding the evolution of political order and democracy, it has in actuality proved very little. To wit, no good autocrats were overthrown. The regimes that have fallen so far had few saving graces in any larger moral or philosophical sense, and the wonder is how they lasted as long as they did, even as their tumultuous demise was sudden and unexpected.  Yet, the issues about which Mill and Berlin cared so passionately must still be addressed. For in some places in the Arab world, and particularly in Asia, there have been autocrats who can, in fact, be spoken of in the same breath as Marcus Aurelius. So at what point is it right or practical to oust these rulers? It is quite possible to force through political change, which leads, contrary to aims, into a more deeply oppressive, militarized or, perhaps worse, anarchic environment. Indeed, as Berlin intimates, what follows dictatorial rule will not inevitably further the cause of individual liberty and well-being. Absent relentless, large-scale human-rights violations, soft landings for nondemocratic regimes are always preferable to hard ones, even if the process takes some time. A moral argument can be made that monsters like Muammar el-Qaddafi in Libya and Kim Jong-il in North Korea should be overthrown any way they can, as fast as we can, regardless of the risk of short-term chaos. But that reasoning quickly loses its appeal when one is dealing with dictators who are less noxious. And even when they are not less noxious, as in the case of Iraq’s Saddam Hussein, the moral argument for their removal is still fraught with difficulty since the worse the autocrat, the worse the chaos left in his wake. That is because a bad dictator eviscerates intermediary institutions between the regime at the top and the extended family or tribe at the bottom—professional associations, community organizations, political groups and so on—the very stuff of civil society. The good dictator, by fostering economic growth, among other things, makes society more complex, leading to more civic groupings and to political divisions based on economic interest that are by definition more benign than tribal, ethnic or sectarian divides. A good dictator can be defined as one who makes his own removal less rife with risk.  While the logical conclusion of Mill’s essay is to deny the moral right of dictatorship, his admission of the need for obedience to an Akbar or a Charlemagne at primitive levels of social development leaves one facing the larger question: Is transition from autocracy to democracy always virtuous? For there is a vast difference between the rule of even a wise and enlightened individual like the late-sixteenth-century Mogul Akbar the Great and a society so free that coercion of the individual by the state only ever occurs to prevent the harm of others. It is such a great disparity that Mill’s proposition that persecution to preserve the existing order can never be justified remains theoretical and may never be achieved; even democratic governments must coerce their citizens for a variety of reasons. Nevertheless, the ruler who moves society to a more advanced stage of development is not only good but also perhaps the most necessary of historical actors—to the extent that history is determined by freewilled individuals as well as by larger geographical and economic forces. And the good autocrat, I submit, is not a contradiction in terms; rather, he stands at the center of the political questions that continuously morphing political societies face.   GOOD AUTOCRATS there are. For example, in the Middle East, monarchy has found a way over the decades and centuries to engender a political legitimacy of its own, allowing leaders like King Mohammed VI in Morocco, King Abdullah in Jordan and Sultan Qaboos bin Said in Oman to grant their subjects a wide berth of individual liberties without fear of being overthrown. Not only is relative freedom allowed, but extremist politics and ideologies are unnecessary in these countries.  It is only in modernizing dictatorships like Syria and Libya—which in historical and geographical terms are artificial constructions and whose rulers are inherently illegitimate—where brute force and radicalism are required to hold the state together. To be sure, Egypt’s Mubarak and Tunisia’s Ben Ali neither ran police states on the terrifying scale of Libya’s Qaddafi and Syria’s Assad nor stifled economic progress with such alacrity. But while Mubarak and Ben Ali left their countries in conditions suitable for the emergence of stable democracy, there is little virtue that can be attached to their rule. The economic liberalizations of recent years were haphazard rather than well planned. Their countries’ functioning institutions exist for reasons that go back centuries: Egypt and Tunisia have been states in one form or another since antiquity. Moreover, the now-fallen dictators promoted a venal system of corruption built on personal access to their own ruling circles. And Mubarak, rather than move society forward by dispensing with a pseudomonarchical state, sought to move it backward by installing his son in power. Mubarak and Ben Ali were dull men, enabled by goons in the security services. The real story in the Middle East these past few months, beyond the toppling of these decrepit regimes, is the possible emergence of authentic constitutional monarchies in places like Morocco and Oman.  Both of these countries, which lie at the two geographical extremities of the Arab world, have not been immune to demonstrations. But the protesters in both cases have explicitly called for reform and democracy within the royal system and have supported the leaders themselves. King Mohammed and Sultan Qaboos have moved vigorously to get out in front of popular demands by reforming their systems instead of merely firing their cabinets. Indeed, over the years, they have championed women’s rights, the environment, the large-scale building of schools and other progressive causes. Qaboos, in particular, is sort of a Renaissance man who plays the lute and loves Western classical music, and who—at least until the celebrations in 2010 marking forty years of his rule—eschewed a personality cult. The characteristics, then, of the benign dictator are evident, at times hewing to propositions set forth by the likes of Berlin: freedom may come as much from stability as from democracy; leaders must adhere to the will of the people, they need not in all cases be chosen by them. Yet in the Middle East these dictators remain the exception to the rule, and this is why quasi monarchies of the iron-fisted Assad or the crazed and tyrannical Qaddafi are now under assault.  THE PLACE where benevolent autocracy has struck deep and has systematic roots is Asia. Any discussion of whether and how democracy can be successfully implemented might, because of the current headlines, begin with the Arab world, but the answers such as there are will, nevertheless, ultimately come in from the East. It is in those Asian lands that conventional Western philosophical precepts are challenged.  The ideology by which Asian autocrats stand in opposition to the likes of Mill and Berlin falls—to some extent—under the rubric of Confucianism. Confucianism is more a sensibility than a political doctrine. It stresses traditional authority, particularly that of the family, as the sine qua non of political tranquility. The well-being of the community takes precedence over that of the individual. Morality is inseparable from one’s social obligation to the kin group and the powers that be. The Western—and particularly the American—tendency is to be suspicious of power and central authority; whereas the Asian tendency is to worry about disorder. Thus, it is in Asia, much more so than in the Middle East, where autocracy can give the Western notion of freedom a good run for its money. The fact that even a chaotic democracy is better than the rule of a Mubarak or a Ben Ali proves nothing. But is a chaotic democracy better than the rule of autocrats who have overseen GDP growth rates of 10 percent annually over the past three decades? It is in places like China, Singapore, Malaysia and Vietnam where good dictators have produced economic miracles. These in turn have led to the creation of wide-ranging personal freedoms, even as these leaders have compelled people against their will on a grand scale. Here the debate gets interesting.   Indeed, probably one of the most morally vexing realizations in the field of international politics is that Deng Xiaoping, by dramatically raising the living standard of hundreds of millions of Chinese in such a comparatively short space of time—which, likewise, led to an unforeseen explosion in personal freedoms across China—was, despite the atrocity of Tiananmen Square that he helped perpetrate, one of the great men of the twentieth century. Deng’s successors, though repressive of political rights, have adhered to his grand strategy of seeking natural resources anywhere in the world, wherever they can find them, caring not with which despots they do business, in order to continue to raise the economic status of their own people. These Chinese autocrats govern in a collegial fashion, number many an engineer and technocrat among them, and observe strict retirement ages: this is all a far cry from the king of Saudi Arabia and the deposed leader of Egypt, sleepy octogenarians both, whose skills for creating modern middle-class societies are for the most part nonexistent.   Park Chung Hee, in the 1960s and 1970s, literally built, institutionalized and industrialized the South Korean state. It was Park Chung Hee’s benign authoritarianism, as much as the democracy that eventually followed him, that accounts for the political-economic powerhouse that is today’s South Korea.   Then, of course, there is the founder of current-day Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew. In 1959, Lee became prime minister of what was then a British colony. He retired from that post over thirty years later (though he continued to exert significant power until very recently). As the British prepared to withdraw in the 1960s, Lee attached Singapore to Malaya, helping to form Malaysia as a bulwark against Indonesian expansionism. When racial tensions between ethnic Malays in the Malay Peninsula and ethnic Chinese in Singapore made the new federation unworkable, Lee seceded and the independent city-state of Singapore was born. When Lee assumed power, Singapore was literally a third-world malarial hellhole beset by ethnic tensions and communist tendencies; it was barely a country in any psychological sense and it certainly could not defend itself against powerful neighbors. Lee turned it into a first-world technological dynamo and transportation hub, with one of the highest living standards worldwide, and with a military that is among the best anywhere pound for pound. Along the way, a strong national consciousness was forged in the vein of a twenty-first-century trading state. Lee’s method of government was not altogether democratic, and his intrusion into people’s lives bordered on the petty and anal-retentive: banning spitting, the use of tobacco and chewing gum. The press, of course, was tightly controlled. Whenever criticized, Lee scoffed at how an uninhibited media in India, the Philippines and Thailand had not spared those countries from rampant corruption; multinationals love Singapore in large measure because of its meritocracy and honest government. Yes, Singapore is green with many parks, and so immaculate it borders on the antiseptic. But it is also a controlled society that challenges ideals of the Western philosophers.   For Lee has provided for the well-being of his citizens without really relying on democracy. His example holds out the possibility, heretical to an enlightened Western mind, that democracy may not be the last word in human political development. What he has engineered in Singapore is a hybrid regime: capitalistic it is, but it all occurred—particularly in the early decades—in a quasi-authoritarian setting. Elections are held, but the results are never in doubt. There may be consultations with various political groupings, yet, in fifty years, there is still little sign that the population is fundamentally unhappy with the ruling People’s Action Party (though its majority has fallen somewhat). Unsurprisingly, Lee makes liberals supremely uncomfortable. Fundamentally Mill, Berlin and many other Western philosophical theorists and political scientists—from Thomas Paine and John Locke to Francis Fukuyama of late—hold that people will eventually wish to wrest themselves from the shackles of repressive rule. That the innate human desire for free will inevitably engenders discontent with the ruling class from below—something we have seen in abundance in the lands of the Arab Spring. Yet, Confucian-based societies see not oppression in reasonably exercised authority but respect; they see lack of political power not as subjugation but as order. Of course, this is provided we are talking about a Deng or a Lee and not a Pol Pot.   To be sure, Asian autocracies are not summarily successful. Elsewhere, political Confucianism is messier. In Malaysia, Mahathir bin Mohamad lifted his people out of abject poverty and easygoing cronyism to mold another high-tech, first-world miracle; but he lacks virtue because of the tactics he employed as methods of control: vicious campaigns against human-rights activists and intimidation of political opponents, which included character assassination. The Vietnamese Communist leadership has lately overseen dynamic economic growth, with, again, the acceleration of personal freedoms, even as corruption and inequalities remain rampant. Think for a moment of Vietnam, a society that has gone from rationing books to enjoying one of the largest rice surpluses in the world in a quarter of a century. It recently graduated in statistical terms to a middle-income country with a per capita GDP of $1,100. Instead of a single personality with his picture on billboards to hate, as has been the case in Egypt, Syria and other Arab countries, there is a faceless triumvirate of leaders—the party chairman, the state president and the prime minister—that has delivered an average of 9 percent growth in GDP annually over the past decade. Nevertheless, Vietnam’s rulers remain fearful of public displays of dissatisfaction spread across the Internet. And there is China: continental in size, it produces vastly different local conditions with which a central authority must grapple. Such grappling puts pressure on a regime to grant more rights to its far-flung subjects; or, that being resisted, to become by degrees more authoritarian. So terrified is its regime of its own version of an Arab Spring that it has gone to absurd lengths to block social media and politically provocative areas of the Web.   HERE IS the dilemma. Yes, a social contract of sorts exists between these citizens and their regimes: in return for impressive economic-growth rates the people agree to forego their desire to replace their leaders. (Truly, East Asian autocracies have not robbed people of their dignity the way Middle Eastern ones have.) But even as such growth rates continue unabated—to say nothing of if they collapse or even slow down—at higher income levels, this social contract may peter out. For as people become middle class, they gain access to global culture and trends, which prompts a desire for political freedoms to go along with their personal ones. This is why authoritarian capitalism may be just a phase, rather than a viable alternative to Western democracy.   To be sure, once the basic issues of food and security have been addressed, pace Mill and Berlin, democracy retains a better possibility of getting it right than autocracy. This is because virtuous autocracies are hard to come by and usually rely on the genius of personality; whereas democracy, regardless of the personalities involved, is systemically better positioned to lead citizenries along the path of development. Of course, we will have to wait until China’s economic growth slows down, or, failing that, continues until enough Chinese have more access to global culture. Only then can we really begin to draw conclusions about whether democracy represents the final triumph of reason in politics.   The genius of both Rome and America lies ultimately in their institutions, which allowed in the first place for their freedoms. True, the history of Rome—and particularly the death of the Roman Republic—is not in the least uplifting relative to the cause of political expression. But it was Rome’s ability to provide a modicum of stability to parts of central Europe and the entire Mediterranean basin—and thus further the cause of personal freedoms (mind you, by the dismal standards of the era)—that is key to its achievement; and something which, in turn, is owed to its imperial superstructure. And as that superstructure became too unwieldy, an emperor like the gruff soldier Diocletian could allow for the division of the empire itself into several administrative parts, thus furthering its life span. America, for its part, is unique in its division of federal, state and local power over a vast continental landscape, allowing for the full expression of its boisterous democracy. Say what you will about the deficiencies of the United States and particularly those of Rome, but they both indicate a very difficult truth central to the outcome of the Arab Spring: it is not about the expressions of freedom in Tahrir Square so much as it is about the building of legitimate institutions to replace illegitimate ones. And because institutions are hierarchical—and social media like Twitterand Facebookdismantle existing hierarchies—revolutions enabled by new technology do not necessarily lead to the building of governing organizations. Criticism is not enough, someone must wield power; hopefully in a way less coercive than before.   Meanwhile, the Arab Spring has raised the pressure on autocrats the world over to truly be good—or at least better. Though, even if they are, they can never ultimately get it right, as demonstrated by Mill’s example of Marcus Aurelius.      Robert D.

Building Boom in Gaza’s Ruins Belies Misery That Remains


Ethan Bronner





June 25, 2011 -- GAZA — Two luxury hotels are opening in Gaza this month. Thousands of new cars are plying the roads. A second shopping mall — with escalators imported from Israel — will open next month. Hundreds of homes and two dozen schools are about to go up. A Hamas-run farm where Jewish settlements once stood is producing enough fruit that Israeli imports are tapering off. 


As pro-Palestinian activists prepare to set sail aboard a flotilla aimed at maintaining an international spotlight on Gaza and pressure on Israel, this isolated Palestinian coastal enclave is experiencing its first real period of economic growth since the siege they are protesting began in 2007. 


“Things are better than a year ago,” said Jamal El-Khoudary, chairman of the board of the Islamic University, who has led Gaza’s Popular Committee Against the Siege. “The siege on goods is now 60 to 70 percent over.” 


Ala al-Rafati, the economy minister for Hamas, the militant group that governs Gaza, said in an interview that nearly 1,000 factories are operating here, and he estimated unemployment at no more than 25 percent after a sharp drop in jobless levels in the first quarter of this year. “Yesterday alone, the Gaza municipality launched 12 projects for paving roads, digging wells and making gardens,” he said. 


So is that the news from Gaza in mid-2011? Yes, but so is this: Thousands of homes that were destroyed in the Israeli antirocket invasion two and a half years ago have not been rebuilt. Hospitals have canceled elective surgery for lack of supplies. Electricity remains maddeningly irregular. The much-publicized opening of the Egyptian border has fizzled, so people remain trapped here. The number of residents living on less than $1.60 a day has tripled in four years. Three-quarters of the population rely on food aid. 


Areas with as contested a history as this one can choose among anniversaries to commemorate. It has been four years since Hamas took over, prompting Israel and Egypt to impose a blockade on people and most goods. It is a year since a Turkish flotilla challenged the siege and Israeli commandos killed nine activists aboard the ships, leading to international outrage and an easing of conditions. And it is five years since an Israeli soldier, Staff Sgt. Gilad Shalit, was abducted and held in captivity without even visits from the Red Cross. 


In assessing the condition of the 1.6 million people who live in Gaza, there are issues of where to draw the baseline and — often — what motivates the discussion. It has never been among the world’s poorest places. There is near universal literacy and relatively low infant mortality, and health conditions remain better than across much of the developing world. 


“We have 100 percent vaccination; no polio, measles, diphtheria or AIDS,” said Mahmoud Daher, a World Health Organization official here. “We’ve never had a cholera outbreak.” 


The Israeli government and its defenders use such data to portray Gaza as doing just fine and Israeli policy as humane and appropriate: no flotillas need set sail. 


Israel’s critics say the fact that the conditions in Gaza do not rival the problems in sub-Saharan Africa only makes the political and human rights crisis here all the more tragic — and solvable. Israel, they note, still controls access to sea, air and most land routes, and its security policies have consciously strangled development opportunities for an educated and potentially high-achieving population that is trapped with no horizon. Pressure needs to be maintained to end the siege entirely, they say, and talk of improvement is counterproductive. 


The recent changes stem from a combination of Israeli policy shifts and the chaos in Egypt. The new Egyptian border policy has made little difference, but Egypt’s revolution and its reduced policing in the Sinai have had a profound effect. 


For the past year, Israel has allowed most everything into Gaza but cement, steel and other construction material — other than for internationally supervised projects — because they are worried that such supplies can be used by Hamas for bunkers and bombs. A number of international projects are proceeding, but there is an urgent need for housing, street paving, schools, factories and public works projects, all under Hamas or the private sector, and Israel’s policy bans access to the goods to move those forward. 


So in recent months, tunnels under the southern border that were used to bring in consumer goods have become almost fully devoted to smuggling in building materials. 


Sacks of cement and piles of gravel, Turkish in origin and bought legally in Egypt, are smuggled through the hundreds of tunnels in double shifts, day and night, totaling some 3,000 tons a day. Since the overthrow of President Hosni Mubarak, the Egyptian security authorities no longer stop the smugglers. Streets are being paved and buildings constructed. 


“Mubarak was crushing us before,” said Mahmoud Mohammad, a subcontractor whose 10-man crew in Gaza City was unloading steel bars that were carried through the tunnels and were destined for a new restaurant. “Last year we were sitting at home. The contractor I work for has three major projects going.” 


Nearby, Amer Selmi was supervising the building of a three-story, $2 million wedding hall. Most of his materials come from the tunnels. 


Karim Gharbawi is an architect and building designer with 10 projects under way, all of them eight- and nine-story residential properties. He said there were some 130 engineering and design firms in Gaza. Two years ago, none were working. Today, he said, all of them are. 


Another result of the regional changes is the many new cars here. Israel allows in 20 a week, but that does not meet the need. Hundreds of BMWs, pickup trucks and other vehicles have arrived in recent months from Libya, driven through Egypt and sold via the unmonitored tunnels. Dozens of white Kia Sportage models, ubiquitous on the street, are widely thought to have come from the same dealership in Benghazi, Libya, that was looted after the uprising there began. 


Hamas’s control of Gaza appears firmer than ever, and the looser tunnel patrols in Egypt mean greater access to weapons as well. But opinion surveys show that its more secular rival, Fatah, is more popular. That may explain why an attempt at political unity with Fatah is moving slowly: the Hamas leaders here are likely to lose their jobs. The hospital supply crisis is a direct result of tensions with Fatah in the West Bank, which has kept the supplies from being shipped here. 


Efforts by fringe Islamist groups to challenge Hamas have had little effect. And it has been a year since the government unsuccessfully sought to impose tighter religious restrictions by banning women from smoking water pipes in public. On a recent afternoon in the new Carino’s restaurant — with billiards, enormous flat-screen televisions, buttery-soft chairs — women without head coverings were smoking freely. 


But such places and people represent a wafer-thin slice of Gazan society, and focusing on them distorts the broader and grimmer picture. 


Samah Saleh is a 21-year-old medical student who lives in the Jabaliya refugee camp. Her father, an electrician, is adding a second story to their house now that material is available from the tunnels. Ms. Saleh will get her own room for the first time in her life, but she views her good fortune in context. 


“For the vast majority in Gaza, things are not improving,” she said. “Most people in Gaza remain forgotten.”

Buying Into Palestinian Statehood


Yossi Alpher, Colette Avital, Shlomo Gazit, and Mark Heller





June 24, 2011— Instead of wasting time and energy trying to revive a moribund Israeli-Palestinian peace process, the United States and European Union should take another look at the Palestinian initiative to seek U.N. recognition in September. What is described in some quarters as a recipe for new strife and confrontation can actually be leveraged into a win-win situation for Israelis, Palestinians and the world. 


The Palestinians under Mahmoud Abbas want the United Nations to grant them a sovereign state based on the 1967 boundaries with East Jerusalem as its capital. That’s all. It is not asking the U.N. to solve the refugee /right-of-return issue or to determine who owns the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. It is opting to convert an intractable conflict between a state and a liberation movement into a state-to-state conflict with manageable parameters. 


Why not offer the Palestinians what they want, but add elements that could render the resolution acceptable to a majority of Israelis? 


Israel wants acceptance as a Jewish state with its recognized capital in Jerusalem. It needs assurances regarding the nature and priorities of future negotiations, with the truly intractable issues postponed to a later phase. It needs solid security arrangements, understandings regarding Hamas rule in Gaza, and a viable incentive from an Arab world that has long offered to reward it for moving forward with the Palestinians. 


Here are the components of a possible “win-win” U.N. resolution regarding Palestinian statehood: 


• Reaffirm support for the resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict on the basis of two states for two peoples and the right of the Jewish and Palestinian peoples to self-determination, without prejudice to the rights of all citizens and minority groups. Recall, in this context, U.N. General Assembly resolution 181 of 1947 that called for the establishment of a Jewish state and an Arab state. 


• Acknowledge institutional and security reform, economic development and state-building efforts — especially in the West Bank, under the leadership of President Abbas and Prime Minister Salam Fayyad, which have helped lay the foundations for Palestinian statehood — and endorse the position articulated by the World Bank and the United Nations that the Palestinian Authority is “well positioned for the establishment of a state at any point in the near future.” 


• Accordingly, support the establishment of an independent and sovereign Palestinian state on the basis of the 1967 lines with its capital in East Jerusalem in parallel with Israel’s recognized capital in West Jerusalem, and with mutually agreed territorial swaps and modifications, subject to negotiation — a state that will live side by side with Israel in peace and security. 


• Recognize that extending the authority of a Palestinian state to the Gaza Strip will depend on effective control there by a legitimate Palestinian government that exercises authority in the West Bank, is committed to the Quartet principles and the Arab Peace Initiative and respects the commitments of the Palestine Liberation Organization. 


• Call for both states to engage in good faith negotiations on the basis of this and previous relevant resolutions and agreements in order to resolve all outstanding issues between them, beginning with the issues of borders, settlements, water and security arrangements. Specifically, security arrangements — including multi-layered international, regional and bilateral guarantees — should confront and neutralize threats and enable the phased withdrawal of Israeli forces from a demilitarized Palestinian state with an effective internal security force and without compromising Israeli security. 


• Note the importance of the Arab Peace Initiative, endorsed by the Arab League in 2002, and call for regional states to assist in creating an atmosphere conducive to negotiation and agreement, including by intensifying efforts to advance coexistence and normalization of relations between Arab League members and Israel. 


A creative and courageous approach to leveraging the Palestinian initiative will not end the conflict. But it could make it far more manageable.

What the Arab revolts leave unanswered


Rami G. Khouri





June 25, 2011 -- My pleasure at speaking this week in Ottawa at a gathering at the International Development Research Center of Canada was compounded by the very thoughtful questions and comments that members of the audience offered.


The audience raised new questions in my mind about what is likely or possibly may occur in the Arab region, as the current citizen revolt moves into its seventh month. The issues they raised revolved around the reality that there is no certain outcome to the developments in assorted Arab countries. While I and many other Arab citizens feel that the wave of democratic transformations will continue to wash across most of the region, sweeping away old and young autocrats and opening the door to new democracies, this is by no means certain.


Economic pressures, for one, could easily create such immense stresses on families that many Arabs who celebrated the Tunisian and Egyptian regime changes may welcome the return of strongmen who restrict citizens’ powers but provide more jobs. I doubt this will happen, but we can never rule it out. The demands of children’s stomachs crying out for food that many families cannot afford to buy are immensely powerful drivers of political behavior.


Another threat that some audience members raised was related to the potential break-up of some countries into smaller units that could be more easily controlled by regional or foreign powers. The first Arab revolt against the Ottomans around a century ago occurred simultaneously with the Sykes-Picot accord, by which France and Great Britain carved up the Arab east into smaller units that were put under the rule of locally chosen leaders whom the Europeans knew they could trust. It is possible that the current transformations might result in security vacuums that local parties or foreign powers could exploit to fragment some Arab states into smaller units that would then be more reliant on foreign support or protection.


Sudan has already split into northern and southern states, while Yemen, Iraq and possibly a few others are similarly susceptible to subdivision into smaller statelets. This raises difficult issues about the inviolability of the current Arab borders that the retreating Europeans created last century. I thought the secession of South Sudan was a perfectly acceptable development, if it reflected the will of the people of the south, and was not imposed on them. The operative principle in such possible developments is whether change reflects the consent of the governed and represents the will of the majority, while protecting the rights of minorities. If Yemenis decide to split again into two or even three states, and this reflects the free will of the Yemeni people, they should be allowed to do so without external interference.


There is nothing sacred or permanent about the borders of any country, especially Arab countries that were mostly created by the handiwork of European colonial officers. Countries evolve and sometimes change shape as a routine historical process. If some Arabs decide they are uncomfortable with their existing state boundaries and they wish to break away and form a separate country, that should always be an option. After all, the world mostly rejoiced when the former Soviet Union and its empire collapsed and some of its constituent republics fragmented into smaller units, notably Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia.


We should be prepared to deal with the specter of existing Arab countries that reconfigure their frontiers and populations while they are reconfiguring their political governance systems.


Another point that was raised in several different forms related to how the current Arab revolt would affect relations with major Western countries, especially since many Western powers actively supported the Arab autocrats who are now being challenged and, in some cases, removed from office. Would newly liberated Arab citizenries seek revenge against Western powers?


My impression is that this will depend on the new policies that these Western powers adopt, rather than on what they did in the past. Most Arabs are critical of Western powers because they unquestioningly back Israel or support Arab autocrats. Should those policies be moderated and replaced by more even-handed postures toward the Middle East, newly liberated Arab citizens would probably be too busy building their new countries to allow themselves to be distracted by lingering resentments from the past.


What is the single most important development that could trigger regime change in some countries now facing domestic challenges and unrest, one person asked? Three reasons come to mind: economic collapse could do so; or key figures in the military and security agencies could stop protecting the regime; or strategically placed commercial, tribal, sectarian and business leaders in society could decide that the current course was disastrous and, in consequence, could bring about the fall of the regime.

Why Israel is wrong about Iran


Meir Javedanfar 





25 June 2011 -- Israel's former intelligence chief, Meir Dagan, has been subjected to a firestorm of criticism – from the Israeli government as well as sections of the media – since he stated that attacking Iran's nuclear installations would be "a stupid idea".


So strong has been the reaction that the prime minister's office even asked him to return his diplomatic passport. What seems to be bothering some Israelis, including Ari Shavit, the respected Haaretz journalist, is that Dagan has now "made the Iranians think they can continue galloping to the bomb because they are not in any real danger".  This claim, though, is a clear example of where some in Israel are getting it wrong with regard to Iran and what the Iranian leadership perceives as serious threats.  Israel has to realise that the Tehran regime is more petrified by what is happening to its economy and among its own population than by the possibility of a military attack from Israel. When it comes to using violence, this regime has had 32 years of experience. It can cope. However, the regime is so frightened of its own population that it breaks up silent demonstrations. It panicked when the shooting of Neda Agha Soltan was filmed and broadcast to the world. It even went as far as to temporarily ban books by Paulo Coelho – simply because his editor in Iran, Arash Hejazi, was seen trying to save Neda's life.


Dagan could be wrong in his assessment but, even if he is right, it does not mean that cessation of a military threat from Israel would induce the Iranian government to "gallop ahead" towards the bomb without any concern.   The biggest reason why Iran's supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, has agreed to talks during the last few years is not the fear of a military attack by Israel. The biggest reason is that he is worried about his country's economy, which is far more crucial to the regime's survival than the nuclear programme. The Islamic regime in Iran has not and will not live on its nuclear programme. It lives on its economy.  Khamenei is worried that if he doesn't negotiate, the west will find it easier to justify isolating his country. This, in turn, will make it easier to gain international approval for tough economic sanctions.  With so much legitimacy lost domestically after Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's controversial election in 2009, Khamenei has even more reason to worry about the impact that sanctions could have on the survival of his regime. This is the main reason why he is negotiating and will continue to do so. This is also why he will be careful, as he was before Dagan's statement, in the way he approaches his nuclear programme.  One also has to ask: which is the bigger reason why the international community is becoming more united against Iran's nuclear programme? Its distaste and concern for Khamanei's desire to have access to a bomb (which is becoming more apparent from clause 35 of the most recent IAEA report), or threats by Israel to attack Iran's nuclear installations? After recent revelations, such as the secret enrichment site near Qom, the former is more true.  To deal with such a regime and to confront its controversial nuclear programme, instead of constantly relying on military threats, Israel's leaders would be better advised to study Coelho's masterpiece, The Alchemist, and page 121 in particular: 


"When you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it."


Israel is no longer alone in its belief that Iran wants to build a bomb. Judging by the support for sanctions, the UN and especially its security council members are more on the side of Israel than Iran. This includes countries such as South Korea that have adopted unilateral sanctions against Iran.  In its bid to stop Iran's nuclear programme Israel should help itself and the international community. The most potent way would be by improving relations with the Islamic world, especially the PLO and Turkey. Israel had good relations with them before. It can do so again.


Fortunately for Israel, and unfortunately for Khamenei, Israel even has the option to hurt the regime on its very own streets.


That option is the cessation of verbal military threats against Iran. Cessation of military threats from Israel will make it much harder for the regime to divert the public's attention away from its falling popularity and serious domestic problems. Silence from Israel will make Iran's leaders more worried, as it will rob Khamenei from an important tool which has helped him, and at a crucial time when the regime is hemorrhaging legitimacy and popularity at an unprecedented rate. The damage such an endeavour will cause is worth the inconvenience of Israeli politicians having to bite their tongues.   Cessation of verbal threats will also prevent significant future damage being caused to Israel's deterrence posture if, at the end of the day, it decides to not to attack Iran's nuclear installations.


Coelho once said: 


"Be careful. You can hurt with your words, but you can also hurt with your silence."


The words of a wise man.

Global oil supplies are healthier than they seem 


Ian Bremmer





June 24, 2011 -- Many of the world’s oil consuming nations, led by the US, shocked oil markets this week as the International Energy Agency agreed to release 60m barrels of oil from strategic reserves over the coming month. The move was intended to offset price pressures brought about by Libya’s supply cut and comes in response to Opecs recent inability to formally endorse new supply increases. The IEA action is also an example of growing concern over higher oil prices in Washington, where the White House is managing political fallout from high gasoline prices as next year’s presidential elections loom just over the horizon.   Yet, a year from now, we’re likely to look back on this moment and find that fears for supply have diminished. There are three reasons.   First, the most substantial fallout from the Arab world’s recent upheaval is behind us. Syria’s Bashar al-Assad continues to  fight for survival and Yemen continues to flirt with failed-state status, but the Gulf’s major oil-producing states are quite stable. So are other major producers. Even in Iran, with its leaders infighting, the green revolution has moved off the streets for now. While there are plenty of long-term structural challenges for many major economies ﻿– just ask China – for the moment there are no more Libyas left to explode. IEA action and the ongoing Saudi supply increases will neutralise what remains of the oil price’s political risk premium.   Second, big additional supply is coming, and it’s not all priced in. Offshore Brazil and Canadian oil sands are no longer new stories, but their collective impact has not yet been fully felt and is often undervalued. Iraq still draws undue scepticism but production there is showing serious promise. The country could add up to 300,000 barrels this year, with more contracts, more exploration and more drilling already in the works. Barring an unlikely and total implosion of the government, it is hard to see production slowing down this decade. The same is true for “tight oil” coming from unconventional sources. We are seeing this begin to play out in North American fields such as the Bakken in North Dakota. As technology and investment are dispersed over the coming year, oil supply should positively surprise.   Third, Saudi supply increases are not dependant on Opec. The country’s oil minister Ali Naimi left the cartel’s Vienna meeting earlier this month with complaints that the organisation had just endured one of its most contentious and least productive gatherings in many years. But that is only because the major oil players were not prepared to pretend that there was agreement on output quotas. With Iran chairing the meeting, an annoyed Venezuela in attendance and an embattled Libya looking on, it was much harder to get the group to put aside their differences and smile for the cameras. The Saudis have the most influence on price-moving output decisions and they increased production just as they had planned before the meeting proved so difficult. Economically stressed oil producers such as Iran and Venezuela always want higher oil prices. But the Saudis and other Gulf Co-operation Council producers maintain a longer-term moderating outlook and they are the ones with the spare capacity to make the difference.   Add that to your favourite economist’s projection on the softness of the global economy, and we may soon be asking whether or not this latest IEA move was worth it.

Robert Gates: America is losing its grip


John Barry and Tara McKelvey





27 June -- Aboard the Pentagon jet on his last foreign trip as secretary of defense, Robert Gates takes a moment to peer across the American horizon--and the view is dire: the U.S. is in danger of losing its supremacy on the global stage, he says.


"I've spent my entire adult life with the United States as a superpower, and one that had no compunction about spending what it took to sustain that position," he tells NEWSWEEK, seated in the strategic communications center of the Boeing E-4B. "It didn't have to look over its shoulder because our economy was so strong. This is a different time."  A pause.  "To tell you the truth, that's one of the many reasons it's time for me to retire, because frankly I can't imagine being part of a nation, part of a government ... that's being forced to dramatically scale back our engagement with the rest of the world."  Such a statement--rather astonishing for the leader of the world's preeminent fighting force--may open the administration to charges of not believing in American exceptionalism, an opening the GOP is already trying to exploit. But these days Gates is less worried about political crossfire and more focused on the legacy of his own tenure, which bridged the presidencies of George W. Bush and Barack Obama. He is determined to define his own legacy as Pentagon boss, and eager to push back against one of the more vocal criticisms of his tenure: the belief among many liberals and some conservative budget hawks that in a time of deep indebtedness, he hasn't been willing to chop enough of a defense budget bloated by a decade of war.  Don't expect him to apologize. In Gates's mind, it's other political leaders with less experience who are confused.


"Congress is all over the place," Gates says at one point. "And the Republicans are a perfect example. I mean, you've got the budget hawks and then you've got the defense hawks within the same party. And so I think there is no consensus on a role in the world."


In some ways, the first part of his tenure was easier. During the Bush years, money was never an issue. By contrast, Obama faced a harsh economic reality, and Gates tried to get in front of the issue by shrinking the Pentagon budget. But his cuts satisfied neither hawks nor doves nor the White House. This spring, when Obama announced a $400 billion reduction in defense spending, Gates got just 24 hours' notice.  Gates, who'll be succeeded by CIA chief Leon Panetta, wins bipartisan accolades for restoring morale at the Pentagon and, more important, repairing relations with Congress, which had grown distrustful of the Defense Department under Rumsfeld.


Bridging two administrations, Gates gets credit for stabilizing Iraq, though the key decisions that led to success--a surge of troops and the appointment of Gen. David Petraeus to oversee the strategy--predated his arrival.   Petraeus says Gates knew that his real contribution was to buy time in Washington for the strategy to succeed. " 'Your battle space is Iraq. My battle space is Washington,' " Petraeus recalls Gates telling him.  Gates concedes he was sometimes on the wrong side of an issue. For instance, he was gun-shy about using ground troops to kill Osama bin Laden, arguing that Obama should opt for an airstrike instead. Gates hesitated because he feared a repeat of the bungled 1980 attempt to free American hostages in Iran that killed eight U.S. servicemen. "I was very explicit with the president in one of the discussions," Gates acknowledges. "I said: 'Mr. President, I want truth in lending. Because of experience, I may be too cautious, you know.'?"   Obama overruled Gates, siding with those who wanted to deploy the elite Navy SEALs, securing the biggest victory in the 10-year war on terror.  Rather than a transformational figure, a more accurate description for Gates may be "steady hand on the wheel," says the Foreign Policy Research Institute's Michael Noonan.


"I don't think [Gates's] accomplishments merit the sky-high reputation that he enjoys as he leaves office," former senior CIA analyst Paul Pillar says. "Gates has long had a knack for nurturing his own reputation."


Pillar recalls that Gates during his CIA days was "always saying, 'I'm going to whip this organization into shape.' Anything good that happens, it's because 'I'm head of the organization.' Anything bad can be attributed to 'institutional resistance.'"


When Gates took over the Pentagon in December 2006, he quickly demonstrated the diplomatic and political acumen he had acquired as he worked his way up through the intelligence community as the first career officer to become CIA director.


Take, for instance, his decision to court Hillary Clinton when she took over as secretary of state in 2009. One of the few senior Bush holdovers in the new Obama administration, Gates was keenly aware of the tensions between the State and Defense departments built up during the war in Iraq. He invited Clinton to his Pentagon office, and the two ate lunch at a table that belonged to Confederate President Jefferson Davis back when he was U.S. secretary of war.


"I just told her, based on my experience, that how well the administration worked would depend a lot on how well she and I got along together," Gates recalls. "If we got along, the message would go to the entire bureaucracy--not just our own bureaucracies but the rest of government as well. She totally understood."


Gates made a calculated--and more public--courtship of her entire agency. "I read in the press, and therefore it must be true, that no secretary of defense had ever been quoted as arguing for a bigger budget for State," Gates boasts now.  The strategy worked. Clinton and Gates try to get together privatelyonce a week to work out differences between their departments, and working with a younger generation, the two have bonded.


"Hillary and I call ourselves the Old Folks Caucus," Gates quips. "And I must say, it's the first time in my life I've worked for a president who was 20 years younger than I was."


Gates's tenure had difficult moments, too. Three years ago, he rejected requests from Gen. David McKiernan, his then top commander in Afghanistan, for more troops, believing there weren't enough resources. Gates stayed the course until 2009, when he argued for the troop surge that now appears to have stalled the insurgency.


Gates acknowledges a historical similarity to the Vietnam War. "There is one parallel that I think is appropriate, and that is we came to the right strategy and the right resources very late in the game," Gates says. "President Obama, I think, got the right strategy and the right resources for Afghanistan--but eight years in."


In Afghanistan, Gates leaves behind a difficult, unfinished piece of business: to convince Congress and war-weary Americans that any major U.S. withdrawal should be delayed by a year--a deferment sought by military commanders on the ground. Likewise, Gates won't be around for what may be the most delicate aspect of the exit strategy--trying to broker reconciliation between the Taliban and the Afghan ruling parties aligned with the U.S.


"I'm not saying it'll all be settled," says Gates. "I'm just saying you could begin a serious dialogue by the end of the year." But, he concedes, "asking for another year is hard."

The National Interest 


The Good Autocrat


Robert D. Kaplan





June 21, 2011 -- IN HIS extended essay, On Liberty, published in 1859, the English philosopher John Stuart Mill famously declares, “That the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others.” Mill’s irreducible refutation of tyranny leads him to—I have always felt—one of the most moving passages in literature, in which he extols the moral virtues of Marcus Aurelius, only to register the Roman’s supreme flaw. Mill writes:


If ever any one, possessed of power, had grounds for thinking himself the best and most enlightened among his contemporaries, it was the Emperor Marcus Aurelius. Absolute monarch of the whole civilized world, he preserved through life not only the most unblemished justice, but what was less to be expected from his Stoical breeding, the tenderest heart. The few failings which are attributed to him, were all on the side of indulgence: while his writings, the highest ethical product of the ancient mind, differ scarcely perceptibly, if they differ at all, from the most characteristic teachings of Christ.  And yet, as Mill laments, this “unfettered intellect,” this exemplar of humanism by second-century-AD standards, persecuted Christians. As deplorable a state as society was in at the time (wars, internal revolts, cruelty in all its manifestations), Marcus Aurelius assumed that what held it together and kept it from getting worse was the acceptance of the existing divinities, which the adherents of Christianity threatened to dissolve. He simply could not foresee a world knit together by new and better ties. “No Christian,” Mill writes, “more firmly believes that Atheism is false, and tends to the dissolution of society, than Marcus Aurelius believed the same things of Christianity.”


If even such a ruler as Marcus Aurelius could be so monumentally wrong, then no dictator, it would seem, no matter how benevolent, could ever ultimately be trusted in his judgment. It follows, therefore, that the persecution of an idea or ideals for the sake of the existing order can rarely be justified, since the existing order is itself suspect. And, pace Mill, if we can never know for certain if authority is in the right, even as anarchy must be averted, the only recourse for society is to be able to choose and regularly replace its forever-imperfect leaders.  But there is a catch. As Mill admits earlier in his essay,


Liberty, as a principle, has no application to any state of things anterior to the time when mankind have become capable of being improved by free and equal discussion. Until then, there is nothing . . . but implicit obedience to an Akbar or a Charlemagne, if they are so fortunate as to find one.   Indeed, Mill knows that authority has first to be created before we can go about limiting it. For without authority, however dictatorial, there is a fearful void, as we all know too well from Iraq in 2006 and 2007. In fact, no greater proponent of individual liberty than Isaiah Berlin himself observes in his introduction to Four Essays on Liberty that, “Men who live in conditions where there is not sufficient food, warmth, shelter, and the minimum degree of security can scarcely be expected to concern themselves with freedom of contract or of the press.” In “Two Concepts of Liberty,” Berlin allows that “First things come first: there are situations . . . in which boots are superior to the works of Shakespeare, individual freedom is not everyone’s primary need.” Further complicating matters, Berlin notes that “there is no necessary connection between individual liberty and democratic rule.” There might be a despot “who leaves his subjects a wide area of liberty” but cares “little for order, or virtue, or knowledge.” Clearly, just as there are good and bad popularly elected leaders, there are good and bad autocrats.  THE SIGNAL fact of the Arab world at the beginning of this year of democratic revolution was that, for the most part, it encompassed few of these subtleties and apparent contradictions. Middle Eastern societies had long since moved beyond basic needs of food and security to the point where individual freedom could easily be contemplated. After all, over the past half century, Arabs from the Maghreb to the Persian Gulf experienced epochal social, economic, technological and demographic transformation: it was only the politics that lagged behind. And while good autocrats there were, the reigning model was sterile and decadent national-security regimes, deeply corrupt and with sultanic tendencies. These leaders sought to perpetuate their rule through offspring: sons who had not risen through the military or other bureaucracies, and thus had no legitimacy. Marcus Aurelius was one thing; Tunisia’s Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, Egypt’s Hosni Mubarak and Syria’s Bashar al-Assad, quite another. Certainly, the Arab Spring has proved much: that there is no otherness to Arab civilization, that Arabs yearn for universal values just as members of other societies do. But as to difficult questions regarding the evolution of political order and democracy, it has in actuality proved very little. To wit, no good autocrats were overthrown. The regimes that have fallen so far had few saving graces in any larger moral or philosophical sense, and the wonder is how they lasted as long as they did, even as their tumultuous demise was sudden and unexpected.  Yet, the issues about which Mill and Berlin cared so passionately must still be addressed. For in some places in the Arab world, and particularly in Asia, there have been autocrats who can, in fact, be spoken of in the same breath as Marcus Aurelius. So at what point is it right or practical to oust these rulers? It is quite possible to force through political change, which leads, contrary to aims, into a more deeply oppressive, militarized or, perhaps worse, anarchic environment. Indeed, as Berlin intimates, what follows dictatorial rule will not inevitably further the cause of individual liberty and well-being. Absent relentless, large-scale human-rights violations, soft landings for nondemocratic regimes are always preferable to hard ones, even if the process takes some time. A moral argument can be made that monsters like Muammar el-Qaddafi in Libya and Kim Jong-il in North Korea should be overthrown any way they can, as fast as we can, regardless of the risk of short-term chaos. But that reasoning quickly loses its appeal when one is dealing with dictators who are less noxious. And even when they are not less noxious, as in the case of Iraq’s Saddam Hussein, the moral argument for their removal is still fraught with difficulty since the worse the autocrat, the worse the chaos left in his wake. That is because a bad dictator eviscerates intermediary institutions between the regime at the top and the extended family or tribe at the bottom—professional associations, community organizations, political groups and so on—the very stuff of civil society. The good dictator, by fostering economic growth, among other things, makes society more complex, leading to more civic groupings and to political divisions based on economic interest that are by definition more benign than tribal, ethnic or sectarian divides. A good dictator can be defined as one who makes his own removal less rife with risk.  While the logical conclusion of Mill’s essay is to deny the moral right of dictatorship, his admission of the need for obedience to an Akbar or a Charlemagne at primitive levels of social development leaves one facing the larger question: Is transition from autocracy to democracy always virtuous? For there is a vast difference between the rule of even a wise and enlightened individual like the late-sixteenth-century Mogul Akbar the Great and a society so free that coercion of the individual by the state only ever occurs to prevent the harm of others. It is such a great disparity that Mill’s proposition that persecution to preserve the existing order can never be justified remains theoretical and may never be achieved; even democratic governments must coerce their citizens for a variety of reasons. Nevertheless, the ruler who moves society to a more advanced stage of development is not only good but also perhaps the most necessary of historical actors—to the extent that history is determined by freewilled individuals as well as by larger geographical and economic forces. And the good autocrat, I submit, is not a contradiction in terms; rather, he stands at the center of the political questions that continuously morphing political societies face.


GOOD AUTOCRATS there are. For example, in the Middle East, monarchy has found a way over the decades and centuries to engender a political legitimacy of its own, allowing leaders like King Mohammed VI in Morocco, King Abdullah in Jordan and Sultan Qaboos bin Said in Oman to grant their subjects a wide berth of individual liberties without fear of being overthrown. Not only is relative freedom allowed, but extremist politics and ideologies are unnecessary in these countries.  It is only in modernizing dictatorships like Syria and Libya—which in historical and geographical terms are artificial constructions and whose rulers are inherently illegitimate—where brute force and radicalism are required to hold the state together. To be sure, Egypt’s Mubarak and Tunisia’s Ben Ali neither ran police states on the terrifying scale of Libya’s Qaddafi and Syria’s Assad nor stifled economic progress with such alacrity. But while Mubarak and Ben Ali left their countries in conditions suitable for the emergence of stable democracy, there is little virtue that can be attached to their rule. The economic liberalizations of recent years were haphazard rather than well planned. Their countries’ functioning institutions exist for reasons that go back centuries: Egypt and Tunisia have been states in one form or another since antiquity. Moreover, the now-fallen dictators promoted a venal system of corruption built on personal access to their own ruling circles. And Mubarak, rather than move society forward by dispensing with a pseudomonarchical state, sought to move it backward by installing his son in power. Mubarak and Ben Ali were dull men, enabled by goons in the security services. The real story in the Middle East these past few months, beyond the toppling of these decrepit regimes, is the possible emergence of authentic constitutional monarchies in places like Morocco and Oman.  Both of these countries, which lie at the two geographical extremities of the Arab world, have not been immune to demonstrations. But the protesters in both cases have explicitly called for reform and democracy within the royal system and have supported the leaders themselves. King Mohammed and Sultan Qaboos have moved vigorously to get out in front of popular demands by reforming their systems instead of merely firing their cabinets. Indeed, over the years, they have championed women’s rights, the environment, the large-scale building of schools and other progressive causes. Qaboos, in particular, is sort of a Renaissance man who plays the lute and loves Western classical music, and who—at least until the celebrations in 2010 marking forty years of his rule—eschewed a personality cult. The characteristics, then, of the benign dictator are evident, at times hewing to propositions set forth by the likes of Berlin: freedom may come as much from stability as from democracy; leaders must adhere to the will of the people, they need not in all cases be chosen by them. Yet in the Middle East these dictators remain the exception to the rule, and this is why quasi monarchies of the iron-fisted Assad or the crazed and tyrannical Qaddafi are now under assault.  THE PLACE where benevolent autocracy has struck deep and has systematic roots is Asia. Any discussion of whether and how democracy can be successfully implemented might, because of the current headlines, begin with the Arab world, but the answers such as there are will, nevertheless, ultimately come in from the East. It is in those Asian lands that conventional Western philosophical precepts are challenged.  The ideology by which Asian autocrats stand in opposition to the likes of Mill and Berlin falls—to some extent—under the rubric of Confucianism. Confucianism is more a sensibility than a political doctrine. It stresses traditional authority, particularly that of the family, as the sine qua non of political tranquility. The well-being of the community takes precedence over that of the individual. Morality is inseparable from one’s social obligation to the kin group and the powers that be. The Western—and particularly the American—tendency is to be suspicious of power and central authority; whereas the Asian tendency is to worry about disorder. Thus, it is in Asia, much more so than in the Middle East, where autocracy can give the Western notion of freedom a good run for its money. The fact that even a chaotic democracy is better than the rule of a Mubarak or a Ben Ali proves nothing. But is a chaotic democracy better than the rule of autocrats who have overseen GDP growth rates of 10 percent annually over the past three decades? It is in places like China, Singapore, Malaysia and Vietnam where good dictators have produced economic miracles. These in turn have led to the creation of wide-ranging personal freedoms, even as these leaders have compelled people against their will on a grand scale. Here the debate gets interesting.


Indeed, probably one of the most morally vexing realizations in the field of international politics is that Deng Xiaoping, by dramatically raising the living standard of hundreds of millions of Chinese in such a comparatively short space of time—which, likewise, led to an unforeseen explosion in personal freedoms across China—was, despite the atrocity of Tiananmen Square that he helped perpetrate, one of the great men of the twentieth century. Deng’s successors, though repressive of political rights, have adhered to his grand strategy of seeking natural resources anywhere in the world, wherever they can find them, caring not with which despots they do business, in order to continue to raise the economic status of their own people. These Chinese autocrats govern in a collegial fashion, number many an engineer and technocrat among them, and observe strict retirement ages: this is all a far cry from the king of Saudi Arabia and the deposed leader of Egypt, sleepy octogenarians both, whose skills for creating modern middle-class societies are for the most part nonexistent.


Park Chung Hee, in the 1960s and 1970s, literally built, institutionalized and industrialized the South Korean state. It was Park Chung Hee’s benign authoritarianism, as much as the democracy that eventually followed him, that accounts for the political-economic powerhouse that is today’s South Korea.


Then, of course, there is the founder of current-day Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew. In 1959, Lee became prime minister of what was then a British colony. He retired from that post over thirty years later (though he continued to exert significant power until very recently). As the British prepared to withdraw in the 1960s, Lee attached Singapore to Malaya, helping to form Malaysia as a bulwark against Indonesian expansionism. When racial tensions between ethnic Malays in the Malay Peninsula and ethnic Chinese in Singapore made the new federation unworkable, Lee seceded and the independent city-state of Singapore was born. When Lee assumed power, Singapore was literally a third-world malarial hellhole beset by ethnic tensions and communist tendencies; it was barely a country in any psychological sense and it certainly could not defend itself against powerful neighbors. Lee turned it into a first-world technological dynamo and transportation hub, with one of the highest living standards worldwide, and with a military that is among the best anywhere pound for pound. Along the way, a strong national consciousness was forged in the vein of a twenty-first-century trading state. Lee’s method of government was not altogether democratic, and his intrusion into people’s lives bordered on the petty and anal-retentive: banning spitting, the use of tobacco and chewing gum. The press, of course, was tightly controlled. Whenever criticized, Lee scoffed at how an uninhibited media in India, the Philippines and Thailand had not spared those countries from rampant corruption; multinationals love Singapore in large measure because of its meritocracy and honest government. Yes, Singapore is green with many parks, and so immaculate it borders on the antiseptic. But it is also a controlled society that challenges ideals of the Western philosophers.


For Lee has provided for the well-being of his citizens without really relying on democracy. His example holds out the possibility, heretical to an enlightened Western mind, that democracy may not be the last word in human political development. What he has engineered in Singapore is a hybrid regime: capitalistic it is, but it all occurred—particularly in the early decades—in a quasi-authoritarian setting. Elections are held, but the results are never in doubt. There may be consultations with various political groupings, yet, in fifty years, there is still little sign that the population is fundamentally unhappy with the ruling People’s Action Party (though its majority has fallen somewhat). Unsurprisingly, Lee makes liberals supremely uncomfortable. Fundamentally Mill, Berlin and many other Western philosophical theorists and political scientists—from Thomas Paine and John Locke to Francis Fukuyama of late—hold that people will eventually wish to wrest themselves from the shackles of repressive rule. That the innate human desire for free will inevitably engenders discontent with the ruling class from below—something we have seen in abundance in the lands of the Arab Spring. Yet, Confucian-based societies see not oppression in reasonably exercised authority but respect; they see lack of political power not as subjugation but as order. Of course, this is provided we are talking about a Deng or a Lee and not a Pol Pot.


To be sure, Asian autocracies are not summarily successful. Elsewhere, political Confucianism is messier. In Malaysia, Mahathir bin Mohamad lifted his people out of abject poverty and easygoing cronyism to mold another high-tech, first-world miracle; but he lacks virtue because of the tactics he employed as methods of control: vicious campaigns against human-rights activists and intimidation of political opponents, which included character assassination. The Vietnamese Communist leadership has lately overseen dynamic economic growth, with, again, the acceleration of personal freedoms, even as corruption and inequalities remain rampant. Think for a moment of Vietnam, a society that has gone from rationing books to enjoying one of the largest rice surpluses in the world in a quarter of a century. It recently graduated in statistical terms to a middle-income country with a per capita GDP of $1,100. Instead of a single personality with his picture on billboards to hate, as has been the case in Egypt, Syria and other Arab countries, there is a faceless triumvirate of leaders—the party chairman, the state president and the prime minister—that has delivered an average of 9 percent growth in GDP annually over the past decade. Nevertheless, Vietnam’s rulers remain fearful of public displays of dissatisfaction spread across the Internet. And there is China: continental in size, it produces vastly different local conditions with which a central authority must grapple. Such grappling puts pressure on a regime to grant more rights to its far-flung subjects; or, that being resisted, to become by degrees more authoritarian. So terrified is its regime of its own version of an Arab Spring that it has gone to absurd lengths to block social media and politically provocative areas of the Web.


HERE IS the dilemma. Yes, a social contract of sorts exists between these citizens and their regimes: in return for impressive economic-growth rates the people agree to forego their desire to replace their leaders. (Truly, East Asian autocracies have not robbed people of their dignity the way Middle Eastern ones have.) But even as such growth rates continue unabated—to say nothing of if they collapse or even slow down—at higher income levels, this social contract may peter out. For as people become middle class, they gain access to global culture and trends, which prompts a desire for political freedoms to go along with their personal ones. This is why authoritarian capitalism may be just a phase, rather than a viable alternative to Western democracy.


To be sure, once the basic issues of food and security have been addressed, pace Mill and Berlin, democracy retains a better possibility of getting it right than autocracy. This is because virtuous autocracies are hard to come by and usually rely on the genius of personality; whereas democracy, regardless of the personalities involved, is systemically better positioned to lead citizenries along the path of development. Of course, we will have to wait until China’s economic growth slows down, or, failing that, continues until enough Chinese have more access to global culture. Only then can we really begin to draw conclusions about whether democracy represents the final triumph of reason in politics.


The genius of both Rome and America lies ultimately in their institutions, which allowed in the first place for their freedoms. True, the history of Rome—and particularly the death of the Roman Republic—is not in the least uplifting relative to the cause of political expression. But it was Rome’s ability to provide a modicum of stability to parts of central Europe and the entire Mediterranean basin—and thus further the cause of personal freedoms (mind you, by the dismal standards of the era)—that is key to its achievement; and something which, in turn, is owed to its imperial superstructure. And as that superstructure became too unwieldy, an emperor like the gruff soldier Diocletian could allow for the division of the empire itself into several administrative parts, thus furthering its life span. America, for its part, is unique in its division of federal, state and local power over a vast continental landscape, allowing for the full expression of its boisterous democracy. Say what you will about the deficiencies of the United States and particularly those of Rome, but they both indicate a very difficult truth central to the outcome of the Arab Spring: it is not about the expressions of freedom in Tahrir Square so much as it is about the building of legitimate institutions to replace illegitimate ones. And because institutions are hierarchical—and social media like Twitterand Facebookdismantle existing hierarchies—revolutions enabled by new technology do not necessarily lead to the building of governing organizations. Criticism is not enough, someone must wield power; hopefully in a way less coercive than before.


Meanwhile, the Arab Spring has raised the pressure on autocrats the world over to truly be good—or at least better. Though, even if they are, they can never ultimately get it right, as demonstrated by Mill’s example of Marcus Aurelius.

very complex. I passed your message. . in addition Im not sure what role you and your boss would like to 
play in the yemen issue moving forward. . I think to progress what you and terje have spoken about, the rebel 
leaders are ready to propose a document they woudl like a cease fire, and halt. If you like I can pass on their 
proposal. THIS IS NOT WHAT I DO. my expertise is only money. . but it seems like your part of the world

You nailed it! (before —1/2 of family). 
Still in China - from Party Congress through Trump "State+ Visit". Many interviews/commentaries (CNN/BBC 
attached). 
More important (from some ultimate reference frame): Radical Breakthroughs. Preproduction going well; 
expect to send by end of month complete preproduction document, with 3-4 pages on each of the 13 episodes - 
refined versions of the prototypes (first two episodes) I sent you in late Sept. Excited. Looking forward to 
discussing content. 
I'll be in NY from —Nov. 21/22 through early January. When to meet? Breakthroughs and of course politics / 
geopolitics (so much).

<h5>CNN International Xi Jinping and the New Politburo Standing Committee Robert Lawrence Kuhn - October 26, 2017 HOST: The author of How China’s Leaders Think: The Inside Story of Past, Current and Future Leaders, Robert Lawrence Kuhn is a longtime advisor to the Chinese government. He comes to us once again from Beijing. We talked this time yesterday. Good to have you back. And we discussed yesterday what we would learn about that lineup of the standing committee. It hadn’t been revealed at that point that we spoke, but we now know and is it correct to say the most significant thing is no sign of a leader in waiting? RLK: I think the most significant sign is who the people are and how they relate to each other. It’s a group that actually respects traditional norms. RLK: There was thought that Wang Qishan, for example, might violate norms by being on the Standing Committee after the traditional retirement age and that’s not the case. There is balance among the member in terms of their geographies, even their political affiliations within the party which internally are important. Two are from Shanghai, two are from the Communist Youth League - one is actually from Shanghai and the Youth League as well but he’s really from Shanghai - two have a long relationship with General Secretary Xi. And then of course General Secretary Xi has the overarching power as everyone says - and that is correct and will be correct for a long time to come.  HOST: Absolutely, well certainly but breaking precedent by not having a young leader coming up behind him and we discussed this yesterday. The transfer of Mr. Xi will remain in power for many more years to come, perhaps revive the position of party chairman and stick around indefinitely. RLK: There’s no question about the power and longevity of Xi. I would put it a little differently. I’d say that it is not even necessary for him to have the party chairmanship or any particular title because of his overarching power by having his name associated with “Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era” - that whole phrase is now in the Party Constitution. Moreover, he already had the designation of “Core” of the Party. RLK: So those two elements – name in Constitution and Core - are totally overarching over any particular title. That said, not having a younger member of the Standing Committee who is an obvious candidate for future leadership, prevents there being a separate power center that could undermine what Xi wants to do. So the fact that Xi will be there until, potentially, the mid-2030s is very real. I think now we should shift our attention to what Xi Jinping wants to do. We need to look at the policies he is putting forth, and see what they mean for China and for the world. HOST: And I want to touch on that in a moment, but given this power and position afforded to him in the constitution no less, I mean where is room for discussion? 2 HOST: If not dissent at least a little difference in opinion when those who don’t agree with him basically, because he’s in the constitution, are against the communist party. They can leave or they can put up with it, no middle ground or perhaps question? RLK: This is a very interesting point and it goes to the party concept of what they call democratic centralism and collective leadership. When Xi was appointed Core about a year ago, which was a very significant move, the party also said it was reaffirming collective leadership. Now that seems on its surface an oxymoron, contradictory, but in the Chinese system it was not, and it’s good to understand why. RLK: Xi has overarching decision making power which he didn’t have before he was made ‘core’. But he is obligated under the system to respect the system - if he continues to do so, and I certainly expect he will - to really listen to all of the opinions of the senior leaders, certainly the people in the standing committee. And to conduct substantial research, reviews with experts, and polling and iterative kinds of research that they do for all their major documents. So he is obligated to do such serious consultation under the party system. Now can he subvert it the way Mao did? I don’t think that’s really possible even if he tried and I don’t think he will do that. So it’s a combination of him now having the absolute power, no question about it, but still respecting party norms of how they go about the research and decision-making process. 3 RLK: Now this will not mean overt dissent from the media. Certainly, that has been suppressed and will arguably for the foreseeable future continue to be. But in the inner circles, he is obligated to continue to seek guidance and get alternative opinions. HOST: Speaking of the media you just reminded me of something and we were having a lovely conversation yesterday. I don’t think either of was being particularly rude or anything. And let’s put up the video because you and I were chatting about, just regular Chinese politics and what was happening and this was what happened in our office. We were shut down by the censors in the middle of our conversation. What does that say about how things are going to be run? RLK: China is extremely sensitive during this particular time of the 19th CPC National Congress. They do that for all national meetings but this is probably the most central time. All elements of media are under strictures. Who knows at what level decisions are made? But even internet connections this week have been terrible because of extreme censorship. I expect that will lessen in the future. But it is endemic of the situation and we will all learn to live with it. As I said, there’s a larger picture here about what Xi is going to do in terms of his people orientation, rejuvenating China, comprehensively deepening reform, and strengthening rule of law. 4 RLK: We have to wait and see how that strengthening of reform and strengthening of rule of law is going to turn out. HOST: Indeed. I do have one final question because Mr. Trump is heading that way in a matter of days really. What does Mr. Xi make of Donald Trump? Donald Trump thinks they’re best buddies. What do you think Mr. Xi makes of Donald Trump? RLK: Before Trump came into office I know very specifically there were various think tanks that were engaging in various scenario planning on how to deal with Trump and his vicissitudes. RLK: And the conclusion was to let it play out, don’t react to virtually anything, and treat the U.S. just like it did in normal times. And so I think that will be the approach. It’ll be very straight forward. China won’t react to the highs or lows. It’ll treat the protocol at a very high level. And I think based on Trump’s personality that he will react well to that. The substance that comes out of that, whether it’s North Korea or trade, will have to wait. We could be quite skeptical about the substance of the results, but I think the form will look good. HOST: It’s going to be fascinating. Robert Lawrence Kuhn, great to have you on again. Appreciate your insights. Thank you. 5</h5>

Xi Jinping and the New Politburo Standing Committee
Robert Lawrence Kuhn - October 26, 2017
HOST: The author of How China’s Leaders Think: The Inside
Story of Past, Current and Future Leaders, Robert Lawrence
Kuhn is a longtime advisor to the Chinese government. He
comes to us once again from Beijing. We talked this time
yesterday. Good to have you back. And we discussed
yesterday what we would learn about that lineup of the
standing committee. It hadn’t been revealed at that point
that we spoke, but we now know and is it correct to say the
most significant thing is no sign of a leader in waiting?
RLK: I think the most significant sign is who the people are
and how they relate to each other. It’s a group that actually
respects traditional norms.
RLK: There was thought that Wang Qishan, for example,
might violate norms by being on the Standing Committee
after the traditional retirement age and that’s not the case.
There is balance among the member in terms of their
geographies, even their political affiliations within the party
which internally are important. Two are from Shanghai,
two are from the Communist Youth League - one is actually
from Shanghai and the Youth League as well but he’s really
from Shanghai - two have a long relationship with General
Secretary Xi. And then of course General Secretary Xi has
the overarching power as everyone says - and that is correct
and will be correct for a long time to come.

HOST: Absolutely, well certainly but breaking precedent by
not having a young leader coming up behind him and we
discussed this yesterday. The transfer of Mr. Xi will remain
in power for many more years to come, perhaps revive the
position of party chairman and stick around indefinitely.

RLK: So those two elements – name in Constitution and
Core - are totally overarching over any particular title. That

Committee who is an obvious candidate for future
leadership, prevents there being a separate power center
that could undermine what Xi wants to do. So the fact that
Xi will be there until, potentially, the mid-2030s is very real.
I think now we should shift our attention to what Xi Jinping
wants to do. We need to look at the policies he is putting
forth, and see what they mean for China and for the world.

Donald J. Trump proudly acknowledges he did not pay a dime in federal income taxes for years on end. He
insists he merely exploited tax loopholes legally available to any billionaire — loopholes he says Hillary
Clinton failed to close during her years in the United States Senate. “Why didn’t she ever try to change
those laws so I couldn’t use them?” Mr. Trump asked during a campaign rally last month.
But newly obtained documents show that in the early 1990s, as he scrambled to stave off financial ruin,
Mr. Trump avoided reporting hundreds of millions of dollars in taxable income by using a tax avoidance
maneuver so legally dubious his own lawyers advised him that the Internal Revenue Service would most
likely declare it improper if he were audited.
Thanks to this one maneuver, which was later outlawed by Congress, Mr. Trump potentially escaped
paying tens of millions of dollars in federal personal income taxes. It is impossible to know for sure
because Mr. Trump has declined to release his tax returns, or even a summary of his returns, breaking a
practice followed by every Republican and Democratic presidential candidate for more than four decades.
Tax experts who reviewed the newly obtained documents for The New York Times said Mr. Trump’s tax
avoidance maneuver, conjured from ambiguous provisions of highly technical tax court rulings, clearly
pushed the edge of the envelope of what tax laws permitted at the time. “Whatever loophole existed was
not ‘exploited’ here, but stretched beyond any recognition,” said Steven M. Rosenthal, a senior fellow at

<h5>JAN 01.27.2017 ECONOMICS: US PERSPECTIVES NATIONAL DEFENSE: IS ANOTHER SPENDING BOOM ON THE HORIZON? + Joseph G. Carson, US Economist and Director—Global Economic Research, joe.carson@abglobal.com President Trump has promised to increase defense spending—and there’s support from key members of Congress. If a large multiyear plan is approved, it would represent a sharp reversal from what has beentheweakesttrendindefensespendinginthepast50years. And the timing and scale would have important implications for the outlook on growth and inflation. National Defense—The Trump Plan President Trump has promised to deliver an ambitious program to rebuild the US military. It would include modernizing US nuclear weapons systems, investing more in cybersecurity, enlarging the navy’s fleet and increasing the number of fighter aircraft for the air force. Trump’s plan also includes additional military personnel—well over 100,000, according to some estimates. The details of Trump’s first Pentagon budget will form part of the overall budget he’ll submit to Congress in late February or early March. The actual funding request for the current fiscal year (which ends September 30) must be completed by April 30—that’s when the current legislation funding the military budget is set to expire. More important, Trump’s blueprint for the Pentagon budget could set the baseline for defense spending for at least the next four years. It’s also worth noting that Trump’s military expenditures could be at the low end of what some in Congress are proposing. For example, Senator John McCain, who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, recently released a white paper on defense spending, Restoring American Power. McCain argues that the US has underinvested in the military for several years, and that it is now vital for the US to substantially increase funding for the Pentagon. His plan calls for a $640 billion defense budget for fiscal year 2018, which is $58 billion above the current budget baseline. Moreover, the McCain defense plan urges an additional $430 billion in military spending over the next five fiscal years. Defense Spending Patterns Are Unlike Other Federal Programs History shows that defense spending programs are unusual in that they’re neither cyclical nor countercyclical. Most often they are based on military and political strategiesaswellasongoingreadinessto respond to or engage in global encounters. Based on historical gross domestic product (GDP) data, there have been three large defense-spending programs in the past 50 years (Display 1). The first buildup Display 1 Defense Spending Comes in Big Waves YoY % Change 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 (10) Nominal Defense Spending Vietnam War Reagan Buildup Iraq War (20) 64 72 81 90 98 07 16 Trump? Through September 30, 2016 Four-year moving average Source: Bureau of Economic Analysis and Haver Analytics occurred in the mid-1960s, during President Lyndon Johnson’s term, and ran for five years. That was tied to the military engagement in Southeast Asia. The second large defense-spending boom occurred during the first four years of the Reagan presidency. This buildup was part of Reagan’s political and military strategy to rebuild the military apparatus after what he saw as years of neglect. The third major increase started during the first term of President George W. Bush. This one was linked to events surrounding 9/11 and the following events in the Middle East. 1 From a political and military standpoint, the Trump defense plan parallels the goals and objectives of President Reagan’s military push.

ECONOMICS: US PERSPECTIVES
NATIONAL DEFENSE: IS ANOTHER SPENDING
BOOM ON THE HORIZON?
+ Joseph G. Carson, US Economist and Director—Global Economic Research, joe.carson@abglobal.com
President Trump has promised to increase defense spending—and
there’s support from key members of Congress. If a large multiyear
plan is approved, it would represent a sharp reversal from what has
beentheweakesttrendindefensespendinginthepast50years.
And the timing and scale would have important implications for the
outlook on growth and inflation.
National Defense—The Trump Plan
President Trump has promised to deliver
an ambitious program to rebuild the US
military. It would include modernizing
US nuclear weapons systems, investing
more in cybersecurity, enlarging the navy’s
fleet and increasing the number of fighter
aircraft for the air force. Trump’s plan also
includes additional military personnel—well
over 100,000, according to some
estimates.
The details of Trump’s first Pentagon
budget will form part of the overall budget
he’ll submit to Congress in late February or
early March. The actual funding request for
the current fiscal year (which ends
September 30) must be completed by April
30—that’s when the current legislation
funding the military budget is set to expire.
More important, Trump’s blueprint for the
Pentagon budget could set the baseline
for defense spending for at least the next
four years. It’s also worth noting that
Trump’s military expenditures could be at
the low end of what some in Congress are
proposing.
For example, Senator John McCain, who
chairs the Senate Armed Services
Committee, recently released a white
paper on defense spending, Restoring
American Power. McCain argues that the
US has underinvested in the military for
several years, and that it is now vital for
the US to substantially increase funding for
the Pentagon. His plan calls for a $640
billion defense budget for fiscal year 2018,
which is $58 billion above the current
budget baseline. Moreover, the McCain
defense plan urges an additional $430
billion in military spending over the next
five fiscal years.
Defense Spending Patterns Are Unlike
Other Federal Programs
History shows that defense spending
programs are unusual in that they’re neither
cyclical nor countercyclical. Most often they
are based on military and political strategiesaswellasongoingreadinessto
respond to or engage in global encounters.
Based on historical gross domestic
product (GDP) data, there have been three
large defense-spending programs in the
past 50 years (Display 1). The first buildup

occurred in the mid-1960s, during
President Lyndon Johnson’s term, and ran
for five years. That was tied to the military
engagement in Southeast Asia.
The second large defense-spending boom
occurred during the first four years of the
Reagan presidency. This buildup was part
of Reagan’s political and military strategy
to rebuild the military apparatus after what
he saw as years of neglect.
The third major increase started during the
first term of President George W. Bush.
This one was linked to events surrounding
9/11 and the following events in the
Middle East.
1
From a political and military standpoint, the
Trump defense plan parallels the goals and
objectives of President Reagan’s military
push. And with McCain’s more aggressive
plan aligned on the same premise of
modernizing and improving the readiness
of the US military, Trump will likely have the
backing of this influential member of the
Republican congressional leadership.
Today’s Economic Backdrop—
Similar to the 1960s
The economic and financial implications of
a large, multiyear defense-spending plan
must be weighed against the economic
environment at the time of implementation.
And from a historical context, today’s
conditions have more similarities to the
economic setting of the mid-1960s than
during the defense buildups of the early
1980s or early 2000s, which were either
in recession or the very early stages of
recovery.
Incontrast,theUSeconomyinthemid-
1960swasalreadyinitsfifthyearof
expansion, the jobless rate of 4.5% was
relatively low and inflation was tame
(roughly 1.5%). Nonetheless, the extra
defense spending boosted domestic
demand growth and added significant
pressure to labor costs, materials and
supplies, and product prices. So much so
that the acceleration in consumer price
inflation(from1%in1961tonear6%in
1970)fromthestarttotheendofthat
businesscyclewasoneofthelargestof
any economic growth cycle during the
postwar period.
Today’s economic backdrop looks similar in
many ways. The economy has been in
recovery for seven years, the jobless rate is
in the mid-4% range and inflation is stable
(at around 2%). While many domestic and
global factors are different now, we would
still expect a large multiyear defensespending
program to add to growth and
put upward pressure on labor costs and
inflation in the coming years. Keep in mind
that we’re coming off the weakest five-year
defense spending trend in the past 50
years, so Trump’s defense spending need
not match any of the prior three to have a
major impact.
Stay tuned for the unveiling of Trump’s
budget and pay close attention to the
defense spending request. A large
multi-year program would definitely lift
inflationary pressures. While we wouldn’t
expect an acceleration like that in the
1960s, a sustained rise of 100 to 200
basis points in general inflation would still
seem reasonable—and far above what the
Federal Reserve and financial markets are
currently expecting. n

After Trump phone call, govt weighs if Modi should visit US early 
ARCH IS MOHAN 
New Delhi,29 March 
The Monday night phone call 
of US President Donald Trump 
to Prime Minister Narendra 
Modi could pave the way for an 
early visit of the Indian PM to 
Washington. The Trump 
administration is keen to host 
Modi. But South Block is look-
ing at the potential deliverables 
from such a visit, particularly 
on H1B visas. The Indian PM's 
political stature has increased 
manifold after his recent elec-
toral successes, while Trump's 
presidential tenure has moved 
from one problem to another. 
Delhi doesn't want Modi to 
invest his substantial political 
capital to help Trump burnish 
his image, without the visit 
yielding positive results for the 
Indian side. Modi is scheduled 
to visit New York to attend the 
UN General Assembly in 
September. But, the Trump-
Modi telephonic conversation 
has indicated to South Block, 
and to those who look at foreign 
policy issues within the 
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), 
that the Trump administration 
is keen to host the Indian PM 
for a bilateral visit in the next 
couple of months. 
Earlier this month, Foreign 
Secretary S Jaishankar, accom-
panied by Commerce Secretary 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi 
Rita Teaotia, was in the US. Last 
week, National Security Advisor 
Ajit Kumar Doval was also on a 
visit to the US. External Affairs 
Minister Sushma Swaraj and US 
Secretary of State Rex W

In his phone call, Trump 
congratulated Modi on his 
recent state election victories, 
expressed support for his eco-
nomic reforms and said he had 
great respect for Indians, and 
said he looked forward to host-
ing the PM later this year. 
The window for such a visit is 
available in May, as well as in

Dear Jeffrey: 
Trust all is well. We are in full pre-production of our "Radical Breakthroughs" series/season for Closer To 
Truth. We expect to have a complete production plan, with contributors, locations and schedule, by mid/late 
November - when (coincidentally) I will be back in NY. 
My next email will add detail, including first (rough) outlines of the first two episodes. I'll be copying the 
producer/director of Closer To Truth, as I will from now on with all reports/communications related to the 
content of the series. Whenever we want to communicate privately, about the series/grant or anything else, 
please use a separate email (or respond to this one). 
I am in Santa Monica for two weeks, then Beijing for the big Party Congress. I may need to stay until after 
Trump's (supposed) visit. Attached are my two recent BBC commentaries on China (N.Korea bomb and 
Myanmar refugees). 
Always available to Skype. 
I am truly excited about the series - nothing like it, could have impact - and I deeply appreciate your 
generosity/support, confidence and trust. 
Take care and warm regards, 
Robert

<h5>BBC World News – Robert Lawrence Kuhn – September 14, 2017 Host: Why is the mass exodus of Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar continuing. Today on Impact we bring you different perspectives, and one comes from Myanmar’s state media which claims the military has China’s backing for what it calls an “Anti-Terror Operation.” It claims the Chinese ambassador told hig- level officials that the operation should be treated as an internal affair.

Robert, thank you for joining us here on impact, and what do you think is the Chinese interest here? RLK: China’s foreign policy is clear historically, but it has been changing under President Xi Jinping. President Xi has a grand vision to create an international community of common destiny, as he calls it, via a new kind of global governance. So, in this situation, what is China’s position? Historically, of course, China’s cardinal principle has been non-interference across international boundaries. But there’s much more here to the story. First of all, China will always skew to supporting the existing government - especially in cases of minority issues because China of course has its own minorities and would not want some new general principle of “responsibility to protect” to be used in an exaggerated way, because it could be applied to China’s situation in Xinjiang or elsewhere. RLK: But there’s more complexity with Myanmar because Myanmar an ASEAN country and China has great political interest in ASEAN, particularly in the South China Sea where Vietnam, potentially Indonesia, Philippines (for a time), were all claimants against China, and China needs support in that  area. In addition, Myanmar is in a critical geographic position for China’s economic concerns. President Xi has the Belt and Road Initiative, this far reaching strategy to build infrastructure across Asia and into Africa and even Eastern Europe. And Myanmar plays a critical position potentially for an oil or energy pipeline that would allow China to get resources from the Middle East and avoid the bottleneck in the Straits of Malacca. For all of these reasons, China would support the Myanmar government. Host: Robert, is China’s support strengthened by opposition from Washington where President Trump’s administration is calling for Rohingya refugees to return to safe zones? RLK: I don’t think that’s a big motivation for China. Far more important are local geopolitics, the Belt and Road Initiative, the potential energy pipeline. I don’t think China considers opposing Washington a major motivator for their strategy. U.S. comments seem normal for these situations, but are fairly ineffectual – look at Crimea or other places in the world where similar situations have occurred. RLK: Refugee crises are great tragedies for the world and it seems like we have more of them. There’s more of a desire for individual groups of people to assert their own independence. We see it in the Kurds, South Sudan, many places in the world. Perhaps it’s our interconnected world of 24-hour-a-day internet, which allows similar people to congregate together and take up their own personal interests. So it’s a very complex situation.

BBC World News – Robert Lawrence Kuhn – September 14, 2017
Host: Why is the mass exodus of Rohingya Muslims from
Myanmar continuing. Today on Impact we bring you different
perspectives, and one comes from Myanmar’s state media
which claims the military has China’s backing for what it calls
an “Anti-Terror Operation.” It claims the Chinese ambassador
told hig- level officials that the operation should be treated as
an internal affair. Let’s get insight from Beijing where we’re
joined by Dr. Robert Lawrence Kuhn, a long-term advisor to
the Chinese government and the author of How China’s
Leaders Think. Robert, thank you for joining us here on
impact, and what do you think is the Chinese interest here?
RLK: China’s foreign policy is clear historically, but it has
been changing under President Xi Jinping. President Xi has a
grand vision to create an international community of common
destiny, as he calls it, via a new kind of global governance. So,
in this situation, what is China’s position? Historically, of
course, China’s cardinal principle has been non-interference
across international boundaries. But there’s much more here
to the story. First of all, China will always skew to supporting
the existing government - especially in cases of minority
issues because China of course has its own minorities and
would not want some new general principle of “responsibility
to protect” to be used in an exaggerated way, because it could
be applied to China’s situation in Xinjiang or elsewhere.
RLK: But there’s more complexity with Myanmar because
Myanmar an ASEAN country and China has great political
interest in ASEAN, particularly in the South China Sea where
Vietnam, potentially Indonesia, Philippines (for a time), were
all claimants against China, and China needs support in that

area. In addition, Myanmar is in a critical geographic position
for China’s economic concerns. President Xi has the Belt and
Road Initiative, this far reaching strategy to build
infrastructure across Asia and into Africa and even Eastern
Europe. And Myanmar plays a critical position potentially for
an oil or energy pipeline that would allow China to get
resources from the Middle East and avoid the bottleneck in
the Straits of Malacca. For all of these reasons, China would
support the Myanmar government.
Host: Robert, is China’s support strengthened by opposition
from Washington where President Trump’s administration is
calling for Rohingya refugees to return to safe zones?
RLK: I don’t think that’s a big motivation for China. Far more
important are local geopolitics, the Belt and Road Initiative,
the potential energy pipeline. I don’t think China considers
opposing Washington a major motivator for their strategy.

bob-woodward/?noredirect=on&amp;utm term=.7fb34bc85d22  
Transcript: Phone call between President 
Trump and journalist Bob Woodward 
Aaron Blake 
President Trump and Bob Woodward discuss Woodward's new book, "Fear," before its 
publication. (The Washington Post) 
Bob Woodward, an associate editor at The Washington Post, sought an interview with 
President Trump as he was writing "Fear," a book about Trump's presidency. Trump 
called Woodward in early August, after the manuscript had been completed, to say he 
wanted to participate. 
Over the course of 11-plus minutes, Trump repeatedly claimed his White House staff 
hadn't informed him of Woodward's interview request — despite also admitting Sen. 
Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) had told him Woodward wanted to talk. He also started the 
phone call by saying Woodward had "always been fair" to him, but by the end he said 
the book would be "inaccurate." 
This is a transcript of that call, with key sections highlighted and annotated. To see an 
annotation, click on the yellow, highlighted text. 
Trump: Hello, Bob. 
BW: President Trump, how are you? 
Trump: How are you? How are you doing? Okay? 
BW: Real well. I'm turning on my tape recorder, with your permission. 
Trump: Oh, that's okay. That's okay. I don't mind that at all. 
BW: I'm sorry we missed the opportunity to talk for the book. 
Trump: Well, I just spoke with Kellyanne [Conway] and she asked me if I got a call. I 
never got a call. I never got a message. Who did you ask about speaking to me? 
BW: Well, about six people. 
Trump: They don't tell me. 
BW: A senator. I talked to Kellyanne about it two and a half months ago. 
Trump: [1. 
BW: She came for lunch. 
Trump: Well, it's too bad. Of course, you and I had a conversation a couple of years ago, 
and so that I think got you there a little bit. And we had a conversation many years ago, if 
you remember, in Trump Tower. 
BW: Yeah, I do. 
Trump: That has to be 20 years ago. And you were thinking about doing a book about me 
then, which is interesting. Who knew it would've been on this subject? Right? That was not 
in the cards at that time. 
BW: That's right. Well, I'm sorry, I... 
Trump: I still remember that. 
BW: I spent a lot of time on this, talked to lots of people. 
Trump: All right. Good. 
BW: And as you know and are living, we are at a pivot point in history. 
Trump: Right. 
BW: And I would've liked to have done that, and I maximized my effort, and somehow it 
didn't get to you, or... 
Trump: It's really too bad, because nobody told me about it, and I would've loved to have 
spoken to you. You know I'm very open to you. I think you've always been fair. We'll see 
what happens. But all I can say is the country is doing very well. We're doing better 
economically just about than at any time. We're doing better on unemployment maybe than 
ever. You know, I mean, if you look at the unemployment numbers, you've heard me say it. 
And we're doing better on unemployment than just about ever. We're having a lot of___a lot 
of companies are moving back into our country, which would've been unheard of two years 
ago. If the other administration or representatives of it had kept going, had kept___you 
know, if the other group had won, I will tell you, that you would have, I think you'd have a 
GDP of less than zero. I think we would've been going in the wrong direction. Because 
regulations are such a big part of what we've done, Bob. 
BW: Well, I understand that point of view. And as you know, it's also a difficult time where 
the political system and you and my business is being tested. 
Trump: Yeah. Yeah. 
BW: I take it very seriously. I've done books on eight presidents, going back from Nixon to 
Obama. 
Trump: Right. 
BW: And I learned something about reporting, frankly, Mr. President. 
Trump: Good. 
BW: I've got to go talk to people and see them outside of the White House and outside of 
their offices, and gained a lot of insight and documentation. And it's___you know, it's a 
tough look at the world and your administration and you. 
Trump: Right. Well, I assume that means it's going to be a negative book. But you know, 
I'm some___I'm sort of 50 percent used to that. [Laughter] That's all right. Some are good 
and some are bad. Sounds like this is going to be a bad one. 
BW: It was a chance missed, and I don't know how things work over there in terms of... 
Trump: Very well. We... 
BW: ... getting to you. 
Trump: Well, if you would call Madeleine [Westerhout] in my office ... Did you speak to 
Madeleine? 
BW: No, I didn't. But I... 
Trump: Madeleine is the key. She's the secret. Because she's the person ... 
BW: Well, I talked to Raj [Shah] about it. I talked to ... I talked to Kellyanne. 
Trump: Well, a lot of them are afraid to come and talk, or___you know, they are busy. I'm 
busy. But I don't mind talking to you. I would've spoken to you. I spoke to you 20 years 
[ago] and I spoke to you a year and a half or two years ago. 
[Listen to Woodward and Trump's call on The Post's "Can He Do That?" podcast] 
BW: A couple of years ago, I understand. 
Trump: And I certainly don't mind talking to you, and I wish I could've spoken to you. But 
nobody called my office. I mean, you went through, I guess, different people.... 
BW: Well, Mr. President, how can I spend all this time talking to people and___like 
Kellyanne and Raj and Republican senators? 
Trump: Who were the senators? No, they never called me about it. 
BW: Senator [Lindsey] Graham said he had talked to you about talking to me. Now, is that 
not true? 
Trump: Senator Graham actually mentioned it quickly in one meeting. 
BW: Yes. Well, see. And then nothing happened. 
Trump: That is true. That is true. Well, that____no, but that is true. Mentioned it quickly, not 
like, you know, and I would certainly have thought that maybe you would've called the 
office. But that's okay. I'll speak to Kellyanne. I am a little surprised that she wouldn't have 
told me. In fact, she just walked in. [to Kellyanne] I'm talking to Bob Woodward. He said 
that he told you. 
Conway: Yes. 
Trump: About speaking to me. But you never told me. Why didn't you tell me? 
Conway: [inaudible]. 
Trump: I would've been very happy to speak to him. All right, so what are you going to do? 
BW: Well ... 
Trump: So I have another bad book coming out. Big deal. 
BW: ... it goes on, and I... What you can count on is that I've been very careful. And 
Evelyn, are you on? 
EMD: Yes. 
BW: Evelyn Duffy, who's my assistant, Mr. President. 
Trump: Hello, Evelyn. 
BW: She transcribed all the tapes because, with permission, I taped people for hundreds of 
hours. 
Trump: Good. 
BW: And I think there's nothing in this book that doesn't come from a firsthand source. Is 
that correct, Evelyn? 
EMD: I believe that's 
Trump: But are you naming names? Or do you just say sources? 
BW: Yeah, well, it names real incidents, so ... 
Trump: No, but do you name sources? I mean, are you naming the people, or just say, 
people have said? 
BW: I say, at 2:00 on this day, the following happened, and everyone who's there, including 
yourself, is quoted. And I'm sorry I didn't get to ask you about these ... 
Trump: I mean, you do know I'm doing a great job for the country. You do know that 
NATO now is going to pay billions and billions of dollars more, as an example, than 
anybody thought possible, that other presidents were unable to get more? And it was heading 
downward. You do know all of the things I've done and things that I'm doing? I'm in the 
process of making some of the greatest trade deals ever to be made. You do understand that 
stuff? I mean, I hope. 
BW: Certainly, I understand and I would've loved to go through a discussion with you about 
NATO, because this goes back to early in your administration and your concern about it, and 
the agreement that the countries have that they would increase their defense contribution, 
what is it, by the year 2024? And you know . .. So anyway, we are ... 
Trump: Well, you know last year, if you see the secretary, [Jens] Stoltenberg, he said I 
believe $44 billion just last year, and that was from last year's meeting. And this year it's 
much more money they've agreed to put up. So it's a tremendous amount of money. No 
other president has done it. It was heading down in the opposite direction. So I don't know if 
you're going to report it that way; probably not. But that's too bad, but that's all right, but 
you know, one of those things. 
BW: Everything is going to be factual. And it is not a good thing for my business, if I may 
say this to you, Mr. President, to the presidency, or to the country, to not have real, full 
exchanges on these. And I broke my spear on it trying to get to you. 
Trump: Well, other than Lindsey [Graham], who did quickly mention it, nobody mentioned 
it. 
BW: You say Kellyanne's there, ask her. 
Trump: Nobody told me about it. Well, let me ask her. Why don't you speak to Kellyanne. 
Ask her. She never told me about it. 
[Conway takes the phone.] 
BW: Kellyanne? 
Conway: Bob, how are you? Hi. 
BW: Hi. Remember two and a half months ago you came over and I laid out, I wanted to 
talk to the president? And you said you would get back to me? 
Conway: I do. And I put in the request. But you know, they___it was rejected. I can only 
take it so far. I guess I can bring it right to the president next time. 
BW: Yeah. 
Conway: But I try to follow all the protocols, or else I'm accused of being somebody who 
doesn't follow protocol. 
BW: President Trump, I just want you to know I made every effort. 
Conway: But you had talked to [former White House communications director] Hope 
[Hicks], right, who said no? 
BW: Listen, I talked to anyone I could. [Laughs] 
Conway: You talked to a number of people and they all said no? 
BW: I talked to Raj. 
Conway: Raj. 
BW: He was going to work it out. 
Conway: Hope. IMe?]. 
[The president says something in the background that is inaudible.] 
Conway: I said you tried talking to everybody? What about when you interviewed, like, 
other people? They all said yes? That they'd try? 
BW: Yeah, well, about six or seven people. I tried. And I couldn't have___you and I spent a 
whole lunch on it, Kellyanne. And I said, I want to cover the substantive issues in foreign 
policy and domestic policy. And you said you would get back to me. Nothing. 
Conway: Yeah. So, I did. I presented it to the people here who make those decisions, but ... 
BW: Who are the people? 
Conway: But anyway, I'll give you back to the president. And I'm glad to hear that you 
tried through seven or eight different people. That's good. You should tell him all the names. 
[Laughs] Thank you. 
Trump: But you never called for me. It would've been nice, Bob, if you called for me, in 
my office. I mean, I have a secretary. I have two, three secretaries. If you would've called 
directly___a lot of people are afraid ... Raj, I hardly have ... I don't speak to Raj. 
BW: Kellyanne is a... 
Trump: I do, I do, and Kellyanne went to somebody, but she didn't come to me. 
BW: Well, does she have access to you? 
Trump: And she should've come to me. She does have access to me. Absolutely. She has 
direct access, but she didn't come to me. And you know what? That's okay. I'll just end up 
with another bad book. What can I tell you? 
BW: It's surprising to me that these people___did Raj have access to you? 
Trump: Not really, but he would've been able to do it. But I have an office. You have the 
office number. I have an office that's directly into my office. 
Conway: [inaudible in background] 
Trump: It doesn't matter. Let me tell you what matters: The economy is the best it's been in 
many, many decades. And it's going to get a lot better. And the country is doing very well. 
That's what's important. 
BW: Yes, sir. I thought I would ... 
Trump: We're doing a good job. 
BW: ... never kind of say, let's not talk about this because the book is done to a president 
Trump: Yeah, I know. 
BW: ... and, but that's the position we're in. And it's one I tried to avoid. You need to 
know I made maximum effort. 
Trump: All right. It's too bad. 
BW: Yes, sir. 
Trump: I'm just hearing about it. And I heard___I did hear from Lindsey, but I'm just 
hearing about it. So we're going to have a very inaccurate book, and that's too bad. But I 
don't blame you entirely. 
BW: No, it's r] ____ it's going to be accurate, I promise. 
Trump: Yeah, okay. Well, accurate is that nobody's ever done a better job than I'm doing 
as president. That I can tell you. So that's ... And that's the way a lot of people feel that 
know what's going on, and you'll see that over the years. But a lot of people feel that, Bob. 
BW: I believe in our country, and because you're our president, I wish you good luck. 
Trump: Okay. Thank you very much, Bob. I appreciate it. Bye.

<h5>                    Does Trump Fit the Evolutionary Role of Narcissistic Sociopath?                      Nathan H. Lents and Robert Trivers  There is no shortage of published psychological profiles of Donald J. Trump that attempt to diagnose him, from a distance, as either a psychopath or a narcissistic sociopath. These profiles, of course, are fatally hindered by the lack of access to Mr. Trump for personal examination and completion of personality inventories. However, exploration of the evolutionary features of these very peculiar personality types may provide insight into this important question.   Psychopaths are indeed an evolutionary conundrum because their particular behaviors are not an obvious path toward evolutionary success. For example, the majority of serial killers are childless when they are killed or apprehended. Narcissistic sociopaths, however, invariably [typically] have families and children whom they support energetically, and many of the traits specific to this phenotype can fairly be called adaptive. This raises the important issue of the evolutionary niche of a narcissistic sociopath within the societies in which they exist.   The psychological profile of narcissistic sociopathy is generally agreed upon and shares many features with psychopaths including above average intelligence, considerable social savvy, adaptability, likeability, and natural skills in the manipulation of others. They are charming, outgoing, and often feign interest in people and subjects and can convincingly fake both sympathy and conscience. If they engage in charitable acts at all, they are only in pursuit of ancillary selfish benefits. They learn well from past experiences, and show no dedication to a set of moral values, religious beliefs, truth, transparency. If they admire anyone, it is other sociopaths that they wish to emulate. Finally, they are effective liars and show a chilling unconcern for the welfare of others.  There is one particular skill that is common to both psychopaths and narcissistic sociopaths and absolutely essential to their nature: cognitive empathy. Emotional empathy, sometimes called emotional contagion, is regarded as the ability and tendency to closely identify with the emotional experience of others, even “catching” their emotions to a degree. Cognitive empathy is quite different. This is a mental skill involving the close observation and interpretation of the actions and emotions of others in order to understand and predict their behavior. It is morally neutral and common in high-functioning individuals across the moral and ethical spectrum. While social workers and therapists use cognitive empathy to help individuals improve their lives, psychopaths and sociopaths use this skill to manipulate, coerce, and deceive others in order to achieve their own ends. While emotional empathy is an innate cognitive feature we share with most social mammals, cognitive empathy is a skill that can be developed and refined and doing so is key to the behavioral patterns of both psychopaths and sociopaths.  However, the ways in which sociopaths differ from psychopaths is key to understanding their evolutionary utility. For example, psychopaths are more likely than the general public to be violent and to end up incarcerated. Narcissistic sociopaths, on the other hand, are usually nonviolent and happy to work within a system of laws and norms, insofar as it suits their goals, because, while they do not hesitate to harm others, it isn’t a specific aim. Instead, they are highly motivated toward the accumulation of riches and influence; whereas psychopaths are often motivated toward sadistic self-gratification and generally do not seek positions of power and wealth per se. (There is some crossover between these phenotypes and sociopaths who do find gratification in hurting others are labeled malignant sociopaths.) Finally, narcissistic sociopaths always seek reproductive success through procreation and aggressive nepotism, which is usually accompanied by extreme in-group identification, e.g., racism, xenophobia, and nationalism, while psychopaths show no allegiance to family, community, or country.  Therefore, the phenotype of the narcissistic sociopath is not a bizarre combination of traits, but rather a set of highly attuned social skills and behaviors aimed at increasing long-term biological fitness through wealth, status, power, and the future success of progeny. In order words, sociopaths are highly adapted. The evolutionary puzzle is not found in the phenotype itself but rather in the interaction of sociopaths with the society in which they exist. Social groups can detect dishonest and manipulative behaviors and act to punish the actors in order to either correct the antisocial behavior or remove them from the group. Dozens of mammal species have shown this very sophisticated and elastic social behavior, but humans and our close relatives are especially apt at detecting and punishing cheaters, freeloaders, and liars.  This sets up both a short-term conflict and long-term evolutionary battle between manipulative narcissistic sociopaths and the rest of society, that is, those who do not wish to be manipulated. Most individuals in a society share a vested interest in maintaining fairness and social order. The equilibrium point is reached through a concept called frequency-dependent selection, the essence of which is that phenotypes can sometimes have distinct advantages precisely because they are rare. Under this paradigm, the infrequency of sociopaths in a population is essential to their success.    Current estimates place the prevalence of narcissistic sociopathy at 1-2% and scholars have held that this rate appears stable across societies and over recorded history (insofar as such a phenotype and its frequency can be inferred from historical sources). This makes sociopathy a candidate phenotype for frequency-dependent selection, especially given how successful they often are. The rarity of narcissistic sociopaths in the population, along with their considerable skill in hiding their true motivations, makes them very difficult to detect. If they were more numerous, however, members of society would become familiar with this particular pattern of social deviance and quickly learn to neutralize it. Furthermore, when narcissists encounter one another, while they may be willing to cooperate with each other in fickle and short-lived alliances, ultimately their goals will collide and the relationship deteriorates into mutually self-defeating conflicts. This, too, acts as negative selection and maintains the low frequency of this peculiar phenotype.  On the other side of the conflict is the selective pressure on the rest of society. Because sociopaths are rare, the intensity of the pressure on society to detect and neutralize them is correspondingly weak. Weak pressure leads to poor adaptation, while sociopaths experience strong pressure and become highly adapted. However, as the sociopath phenotype finds evolutionary success, the pressure flips back the other direction as the rest of society experiences increasing pressure, adapts, and then pushes the frequency of the sociopaths back down to the basal level. In human culture, this pendulum swings in both the long time scales of genetic evolution and the short time scales of cultural evolution. In both contexts, the conflict is cyclical.  With this evolutionary framework in mind, we can now return to the question of President Trump. Clearly, he attracts devoted supporters. When it serves him, he can be affable, charming, and flattering. He reads people well and can maneuver through his relationships in order to obtain the best “deal” for himself. While many question his capacity for emotional empathy, his skills in cognitive empathy are undeniable.  However, he also has maintained an unwavering pursuit of wealth, influence, and power, even by his own admission. He has never participated in regular religious observance, is not outwardly pious, and shows no allegiance to political party. It is well documented that his views have shifted, sometimes repeatedly, on the most central political questions of the day such as abortion, government involvement in healthcare, military interventionism, federal drug policy, and LGBTQ rights. While only his critics view him as racist and xenophobic, even his supporters see him as fiercely nationalistic and his own campaign slogan of “America First” underscores this. And finally, he aggressively pursues his own biological fitness through the placement of his children in top positions in both his business enterprises and his presidential administration. Thus, an evolutionary analysis reveals that he is clearly not a psychopath.  Whether or not he is a narcissistic sociopath, then, depends on the answers to questions about his conscience or lack thereof, commitment to truth and transparency, sincerity in his religious beliefs, fidelity to political ideals, and tendency to cheat, deceive, and coerce. These questions are more like Rorschach tests in which his supporters and detractors come to the exact opposite conclusions. However, for the most part, the answers to these questions do not require a psychological analysis of the President. There is abundant evidence in the public record.     </h5>

Trump Hands China an Easy
Win in the Trade War
The presidentʼs tough rhetoric plays into Chinese economic
nationalism.
By Kevin Rudd
Mr. Rudd, a former prime minister of Australia, is the president of the Asia Society Policy
Institute.
May 29, 2019
When President Trump tweeted on May 5 that the China trade deal was off, the historical echoes
in Beijing were loud and clear. Almost exactly 100 years earlier, China’s “May Fourth Movement”
of 1919 was a direct response to the actions of President Woodrow Wilson at the end of World War
I. Wilson had promised China, an American ally, that German colonies in Shandong would be
returned to Chinese sovereignty, but instead handed them to Japan. China exploded with anti-
American, nationalist sentiment. One of the eventual consequences was the establishment of the
Chinese Communist Party, which for the last 70 years has ruled the country.
Thus, Mr. Trump has handed Xi Jinping a remarkably effective nationalist card to play at a time
when he has been under pressure at home because of a slowing economy. The Chinese media is
now full of accounts of the country’s economic resilience and appeals to patriotism, even invoking
the spirit of the Korean War, when, according to the official narrative, China was able to stare
down the vastly superior American military.
And just in case people didn’t get the point, Mr. Xi recently visited Jiangxi, the starting point of
the Long March in 1934, in which the Communist Party endured many hardships but ultimately
emerged victorious.
I can almost hear members of the Trump administration groaning. Why on earth would they need
to take into consideration events in China’s ancient past?
The answer depends on what Mr. Trump’s primary objective is. If it’s to sound tough to American
voters, he may well have a winning formula. But if it’s to bring about a substantive change in
China’s negotiating posture toward a bilateral trade agreement, one that might usher in changes
in China’s trade policy, addressing questions of forced technology transfers, intellectual property
theft, industrial subsidies, currency manipulation and a phalanx of other non-tariff barriers, I’m
not so sure.

Opinion | Michelle Cottle
Donald Trumpʼs Great Patriotic Wars May 26, 2019
Economic analysts, meanwhile, have been calculating the impact of a full-blown trade war,
estimating a loss of about 1.2 percentage points to Chinese G.D.P. growth. This figure is now
portrayed in the Chinese media as entirely manageable given China’s capacity to use fiscal and
monetary policy stimulus to support domestic demand and keep growth above 6 percent.

American goods, with America yielding on the retention of tariffs, and the unilateral right to
impose tariffs later. However, the degree of difficulty in getting to an agreement has now
increased substantially.
The bottom line is that nationalism is not just a factor in Trump’s America. It’s now a big factor in
Xi Jinping’s China as well, reinforced through the prism of Chinese history. In most of its dealings
with America over the last 100 years, China has seen itself as weak. Today, in Beijing’s view,
China is weak no longer.

This being said, I have received e-mails from both you and Larry this weekend. 
I called Larry and he said I should send you an e-mail. 
I called a close friend of mine inquiring about the GV market and aircraft that are "not published". As of today, there are 
eight (8) of these aircraft that are not yet on the market. 
Let me know if you would like to speak with him and by what means (you call him, he call you, call Larry?....whatever). 
By the way, his company sold Trumps 727 and got Trump a very attractive number for an aircraft that was on it's way to 
a museum. 
Hope all is well.

WASHINGTON — Just over a 
year after the Sept. 11 attacks, the 
C.I.A. dispatched the veteran 
clandestine officer Gina Haspel to 
oversee a secret prison in Thai-
land. Shortly after, agency con-
tractors in the frantic hunt for the 
conspirators waterhoarded a 
Qaeda suspect three times and 
subjected him to brutal interroga-
tion techniques. 
Ms. Haspel's time running the 
prison, code-named Cat's Eye, be-
gan her deep involvement in the 
agency's counterterrorism opera-
tions and showed her willingness 
to take part in the agency's rendi-

program, which shaped her ca-
reer. She was a rising star until

Trump ousted his secretary ot 
state, Rex W. Tillerson, on Tues-
day, the most dramatic in a cas-
cade of personnel moves that sug-
gest Mr. Trump is determined to 
surround himself with loyalists 
more willing to reflect his "Amer-
ica First" views. 
Mr. Trump announced he would 
replace Mr. Tillerson with Mike 
Pompeo, the C.I.A. director and 
former Tea Party congressman, 
who has cultivated a close rela-
tionship with the president and 
has taken a harder line than Mr. 
Tillerson on critical issues like 
Iran and North Korea. 
Mr. Tillerson's dismissal, on the 
heels of Gary D. Cohn's resigna-
tion as Mr. Trump's chief eco-
nomic adviser after a dispute ovel 
steel tariffs, pulls the Trump acl 
ministration further out of the eel 
nomic and foreign policy mai 
stream and closer to the nation 
ist ideas that animated 
Trump's 2016 presidential c 
paign.

Trump's 6727 sold for 2.7M,. 
Sean very discussed with me this company was interested, unless he call you,. 
From Sean: 
This buyer did have specs on your aircraft. They were looking at a 3.0 million budget but did not make 
an offer and it was too low. We did discuss it

Howard Schult 
By Daryl Cagle on Feb 09, 2019 12:13 pm 
I forgot to post my cartoon from week before last, about Howard Schultz, the prospective independent presidential 
candidate, billionaire and Starbucks magnate. Schultz threatens to split the vote for a Democratic party candidate, 
possibly throwing the election to Donald Trump. 
The two legged Starbucks mermaid logo is so disturbing that I love to 
draw it whenever I can. Here's the original Starbucks logo, that customers didn't like. 
The logo was intended to depict the merger of two coffee companies, the original Starbucks and Howard Schultz's 
company, // Gomale that purchased Starbucks. Starbucks has a nautical theme to go with the character of Seattle. 
"Starbuck" was the name of the first mate in the novel Moby Dick. 
This two legged, merger-mermaid is nasty, which makes it great fodder for cartoons. I drew the mermaid last year when 
there was a racism scandal at Starbucks, leading the company to shut down for a day to do racial sensitivity training. This 
logo-fish-girl would scare anybody!

Jeff Bezos and David Pecker 
By Daryl Cagle on Feb 08, 2019 06:04 pm 
Here's my new cartoon on the world's richest man, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, and the National Enquirer's (AM I) CEO David 
Pecker, who was blackmailing Bezos. Pecker's AMI was extorting Bezos, demanding that the Washington Post (which 
Bezos owns) hold back publication on their investigation of AMI, and that Bezos stop a private investigator he hired to look 
into AMI — otherwise they would publish photos of Bezos' penis. Bezos was brave to expose Pecker's extortion. 
It is interesting that Pecker and AMI seems to have such success with blackmail that his attorneys didn't step back to think 
of what would happen if the person they were blackmailing simply made their emails public. 
AMI is looking pretty sleazy these days, with likely links to Saudi Arabia, and a reported safe full of Donald Trump secrets, 
among other tawdry stuff. So, I took advantage of Pecker's dickish name and pulled Pecker's pants down. Some cartoons 
are fun to draw — even if editors won't publish them much.

Subject: Patterson 
A few things to think about: 
If the Patterson book is being published in August, that presents some time frame issues. You would not be 
able to do a competing book or documentary before then. This is not to say that they shouldn't be pursued. In 
a sense, better that they know what Patterson's position is and, a year from now say, be able to counter it. I 
have some thoughts on book and doc to share at your convenience. 
That being said, you do need an immediate counter narrative to the book. I believe Trump offers an ideal 
opportunity. It's a chance to make the story about something other than you, while, at the same time, letting 
you frame your own story. Also, becoming an anti-Trump voice gives you a certain political cover which you 
decidedly don't have now. Still, this necessary involves you going public. And so the most basic decision is 
about your willingness to do that. My view is that in a couple of weeks you could master message and 
technical proficiency. I know a bunch of people who could be very helpful here. This would involve something 
along the lines of you writing an op-ed, doing a high profile television interview (Charlie Rose, I'd say), and 
perhaps some social media efforts. 
Speaking of which, again, I think a strategic plan, involving your public identity, philanthropic activities and 
interests, and the development of media allies, ought finally to be put in place. A big, comprehensive, 
expensive effort. 
The alternative is to continue to keep head down and hope Patterson book is just more he-said she-said and 
Connolly getting lost in the reeds (which, as an inveterate conspiracist, he always does). My worry is that 
Patterson can be counted on to produce a bestseller, and while he isn't regarded as a serious writer, he'll 
surely be unloading a lot of tabloid copy. Because this will be tied to the election, the Trump-Clinton angle will 
amp up the attention 10-fold, in fact, possibly, a hundred fold. Possibly more than anything you've 
encountered before. 
Meanwhile--
In a lawyer's letter, I'd suggest including the following points--not necessarily legal, but a warning about how a 
press campaign might unfold (publishers are more worried about being caught in negative media controversy 
than they are of legal threats): 
1) Little, Brown has made on the record representations to at least one well-known journalist that it was not 
publishing a book by James Patterson about Jeffrey Epstein--possibly an effort to avoid inquiries about the 
questionable nature of the book; 
2) The actual author of the book, John Connolly, is someone other than the stated author, James Patterson. 
Connolly is known to have developed an obsession with Epstein, such that, his longtime employer, Vanity Fair, 
has refused to allow him to write about Epstein for the magazine; 
3) Sources have confirmed for us that Patterson has had little more than a minimal consulting role in the book, 
and that Connolly has functioned in every material way as the book's researcher and writer. We believe 
Patterson's "authorship" of the book will not stand up to scrutiny. And, indeed, that the entire notion of an 
extension of the Patterson franchise into nonfiction, as it has been used in fiction and children's book--
effectively other authors writing under the Patterson name—presents a host of journalism ethical issues.

Jeffrey-
I need to start off by stating that it is not my intent to go around Shawn Lancaster on this — Shawn is a friend. 
This being said, I have received e-mails from both you and Larry this weekend. 
I called Larry and he said I should send you an e-mail. 
I called a close friend of mine inquiring about the GV market and aircraft that are "not published". As of today, there are 
eight (8) of these aircraft that are not yet on the market. 
Let me know if you would like to speak with him and by what means (you call him, he call you, call Larry?....whatever). 
By the way, his company sold Trumps 727 and got Trump a very attractive number for an aircraft that was on it's way to 
a museum. 
Hope all is well.
