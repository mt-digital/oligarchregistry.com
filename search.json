Thought it would amuse you. Tell me what you \nthink of it. \nxoxo Peggy \nHD: Wall Street, Take Two \nDEK: In the upcoming sequel to Oliver Stone's groundbreaking film, Gordon Gekko gets out of jail and back \nto business. Peggy Siegal takes us behind the scenes where she got herself on camera along with a few of her \nfamous friends. Nice work if you can get it. \nIn 1987, right after director Oliver Stone won the Academy Award for \"Platoon,\" he immediately turned to a \ndomestic arena and began working on \"Wall Street\" in New York City where his father had been a \nstockbroker. Although the film was widely seen as a scathing critique of the culture of Wall Street, Stone has \nsaid that part of the film is a defense of capitalism, his father's vision of finance (as seen through the Hal \nHolbrook character) and an homage to his father. \nAt the time Oliver was also fascinated with the connection between the psyche of Latino Miami drug dealers \nfrom his earlier \"Scarface\" script and the American-born 28- to 35-year-old, white collar stockbrokers. Both \ngroups had an animalistic need to obtain big and fast money. They shared an obsession with corruption and \ngreed. \nOliver sent his actors to Bear Stearns for research, including then-newcomer Charlie Sheen, who played Bud \nFox, a kid from nowhere. When he learns to cold call, and lands one big client, Gordon Gekko, Fox is thrust \ninto the fast lane with a rock star financial mentor who teaches him corruption. \nOliver needed an old-fashioned villain to create drama, and he cast Michael Douglas as Gekko against type. \nMichael was not known as a heavy at the time, but as a charming, handsome, sensitive leading man. Oliver \nalso saw the anger, confidence, salesmanship and style that Michael brought to the role. Michael's Gekko \nlooked a bit like Laker's coach Pat Riley with his slicked back hair and well-cut suits, and it became Michael's \nmost important role, winning him the Academy Award for the villain no one could ever forget. \nWhen Gekko delivers his speech, \"Greed, for lack of a better word, is good. Greed is right. Greed works,\" \ncinematic history was made. \n\"Wall Street\" was set in 1985, a time before ten financial news networks broadcasting 24/7 existed. The entire \nfinancial services industry was largely unknown and Oliver Stone nailed it. \nFour years ago, Wall Street's producer Ed Pressman decided it was time for a sequel and met with Fox Film \nEntertainment co-chairmen Tom Rothman and Jim Gianopulos. Michael Douglas was immediately on-board \npending script approval. Steven Schiff wrote the first script before the global economic crash of 2008 rendered \nit obsolete. \nAlan Loeb was brought in for a rewrite. Pressman asked me to meet Loeb at the Carlyle Hotel to explain the \nsocial rhythms of New York's financial high society. Whereas Gekko's character was modeled after '70s junk \nbond kings (Michael Milken) and '80s mergers and acquisitions killers (Henry Kravis), Loeb bases the new \nvillain on hedge fund billionaires like John Paulson and Mike Novogratz, geniuses who have created \nstratospheric wealth beyond Gordon Gekko's wildest dreams. When Oliver Stone agreed to direct, he rewrote a \nportion of the script to focus on bankers as well as hedge funders, taking no screen credit. \nThis past September, Oliver yelled, \"action\" as Gordon Gekko, with long grey hair, comes back to life as he \nemerges from a lengthy prison stint shot outside of Sing Sing in Ossining, New York. Gekko is desperate to \nredefine himself in a different era. The New York Post runs a full-page photo of Gekko and New Yorkers \nimmediately become obsessed with the filming of Wall Street 2. \nA week into shooting, a glorious fall day. Ed Pressman invites me on the set at the Central Park Zoo. Oliver \ndesigns an elaborate tracking shot around the seal pool where Gekko, fresh from jail, walks and talks to Jake \nMoore, a young idealistic investment banker played by Shia LaBoeuf. They discuss Gekko's daughter Winnie, \nMoore's fiancée, played by Carrie Mulligan, who is also having an off-screen romance with LaBoeuf. Oliver \nplayed Cupid. Moore invites Gekko to the Alzheimer's Ball at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Gekko, who \nused to be a sponsor or honoree of such events, cannot even afford a ticket. \nThe shot starts with a barking seal jumping for fish, then pans down to the actors. Extras weave in and out. In \none take Michael makes a wrong turn and ends up at the monkey house. Everyone laughs. The atmosphere on \nthe set is courteous but quick and tense. There is pressure when you are making a sequel to a hit. \nI watch the action on monitors while sitting on the producers' canvas chairs with Pressman, Eric Kopeloff \n(\"Monsters Ball\") and Celia Costas, who was a location manager on the first \"Wall Street.\" They have asked \nme to be an extra in the Alzheimer's Ball scene and bring some friends to play rich Upper East Side socialites. \nOliver wants over the top glam, go-to-the-vault jewels and couture gowns. \"Give me the night before the \nTitanic goes down,\" were his exact words. Not a problem. \nI pay a quick visit to Michael in his trailer on Fifth Avenue where he is resting. We go way back. I was his \npersonal publicist when he won the Golden Globe and Oscar for Best Actor for \"Wall Street\" and we have \nremained great friends. Gekko is just as challenging for him the second time because of endless pages of \ntechnical financial dialogue. We discuss Catherine Zeta-Jones' Broadway debut in a \"Little Night Music.\" \nMichael has a stack of partially finished handwritten thank you notes next to him for gifts received for \ntheir shared birthday party on September 25th at the St. Regis. Her 40th and his 65th. \nI tell him I have been cast as an extra in two scenes and he laughs knowing I am desperate to hang around him \nand the production. \n8:30 a.m. on Wednesday, October 21st, another warm, stunning fall day. I report to the wardrobe trailer on \n65th Street and Madison Avenue. I carry four elaborate cocktail dresses and bags of matching accessories. My \nhair is in rollers. Statuesque Julia Koch walks over from her Park Avenue apartment carrying her white \nValentino and long diamond earrings. Her real-life financial titan husband David is unaware where she is this \nmorning. \nVanity Fair's keeper of the Best Dressed List, Amy Fine Collins, arrives totally organized in turquoise vintage \nGeoffrey Beene, and Vogue's fashion editor Hamish Bowles wears a riot of plaids, patterns and a large yellow \nfake flower on his lapel. Costume Designer Ellen Mirojnick, who created Gordon Gekko's rich slick look in the \nfirst film, is ecstatic with the extras I invited. \nOliver is shooting a scene with Josh Brolin (the star of Stone's \"W\"). His character Bretton (never Bret) \nJames, a ruthless Wall Street kingpin, and his perfect wife Samantha (Noelle Beck) are hosting a benefit piano \nrecital for a 13-year-old child prodigy in their huge, art-filled townhouse at 41 East 65th Street. The building \nactually belongs to Baby Jane Holzer, a wealthy art collector still famous for hanging with Andy Warhol in the \n'60s. The production designer had Jane's fabulous Warhols moved to storage and replaced with matching \nphotographic copies. Very expensive contemporary art is again an important production element of Oliver's \nvision. \nAt 10:30 a.m., all the extras are placed around the living room set. Oliver's French mother, Jacqueline Stone, \nand her friend Monique Van Vooren, both in their 80s, are seated in front of the fireplace chatting in French. \nProduction assistants fuss over them. Debonair macho man Chuck Pfieffer, who appeared in the original film, \nand I immediately invent a back story—I am his corporate wife—and we position ourselves on a couch next to \nthe director's mother. Julia gets the best spot close to the piano and Amy, Hamish and decorator Geoffrey \nBradfield are right behind her. Josh is brought in and the kibitzing stops. \nOliver appears on the set with eagle eyes and a sly grin and quickly re-positions everyone. He explains the \nscene, gives out lines to his favored extras, and on his way out to the monitors in the next room mentions that \nmy earrings are too small. Wardrobe jumps. Josh rehearses and Oliver finally yells, \"Action.\" The kid plays \nthe piano, Josh explains why we are in his home, asks for money, the camera dollies as extras say their lines \nand Shia appears at the door uninvited for a confrontation with Josh. Three hours later a PA yells, \"Lunch\". \nIn costume, Amy, Hamish and I run to The Monkey Bar. I am late to meet \"The Harpies,\" including Liz \nSmith, Barbara Walters, Cynthia McFadden, Nora Ephron, Jennifer Isham, Maury Perl and Beth Kseniak. \nGraydon Carter is at the next table. I tell him Oliver Stone wants him in \"Wall Street 2\" as an extra. (I make \nthis up.) Graydon jokes that he only works with lines. I say, \"Not a problem.\" (This will be news to Oliver.) \nBack on the set I tell Oliver that Graydon is willing to be in the film with lines. Oliver finds that intriguing. \nOliver shoots the piano recital scene over and over again from different angles all afternoon. Financial wizard \nDon Marron saunters on the set to visit and Oliver spontaneously puts him in a scene chatting with Josh. Carrie \nMulligan hangs out watching boyfriend Shia work. \nAt sundown Julia Koch has to race from reel to real life and explain to her husband where she has been all day. \n(He loves it.) \nChuck Pfieffer plants a \"Page Six\" item and the next day socialites begin calling me to get into the film. \nThursday, November 5, Shun Lee Restaurant, West 65th Street \nOliver shoots a crowded tight interior scene with Michael, Carrie and Shia, who are having an intimate \nChinese dinner. Spontaneously, Oliver decides this is the perfect scene for Graydon Carter. After a flurry of \ncalls, Graydon arrives on set, and playing himself, sashays by the table. Gekko jumps up to say hello and \nGraydon brushes him off with a few dismissive lines. \nMonday, November 9, 25 Broadway \nOne hundred swells show up at the former Canard Shipping building, a massive Italianate hall, at the crack of \ndawn for the Alzheimer's Ball, a grand charity event. \nSusan Hess and I are chauffeured downtown with our Vera Wang gowns and report to the VIP extra holding \narea where we join Prince Dimitri of Yugoslavia in a bespoke dinner jacket, journalist Christopher Mason, \nsongstress Yanna Avis, photographer Kelly Klein, art dealer Larry Gagosian's girl friend Shala Monroque in \nsee-through Rodarte, beauty executive Olivia Chantecaille, producer Lawrence Robins, author Jackie Weld \nDrake, Vogue film critic Joan Juliet Buck, fashion consultant Jill Fairchild, CNN's Felicia Taylor and Italian \nnewsman Mario Calvo-Platero. \nEllen Mirojnick and her costume department have assembled racks of the most expensive elaborate designer \ngowns and work at break neck speed styling while we wildly strip to our undies in a makeshift dressing area. \nEllen pours me into a black tulle Marchesa with a enormous wired silver bow. Twenty hairdressers and make-\nup artists systematically work on 250 extras. A mile of tables are alternately filled with steaming coffee, \nfattening breakfast foods, hair sprays, mirrors, shoes and jewelry. It's a madhouse of excitement. \nWe are led to the part of the set used for the cocktail reception and placed around Michael Douglas and Charlie \nSheen stand-ins. Charlie has been flown in from LA for half a day's work to reprise his original character. He \nis now the highest paid television actor commanding two million dollars an episode of \"Two and a Half Men.\" \nOliver arrives on the set greeting, examining, tweaking the shot and always pulling the prettiest girls closest to \nthe camera. Michael and Charlie arrive from their trailers and run their lines as socials drift into their sight \nlines challenging their concentration on pages of dialogue. Oliver yells, \"Action\" as the extras aggressively \njockey for face time. Charlie is not having an easy day and they do take after take. My corporate husband \nChuck Pfieffer has gotten his real girlfriend Lisa Crosby in the film and my marriage has become a threesome. \nSensing our concern of not making it onto the silver screen Oliver tells his first assistant director to seat a \ndinner table with Susan Hess, Jill Fairchild, Prince Dimitri, Chuck Pfieffer, Grace Meigher and Mario Calvo-\nPlatero. He directs us to chat with each other turning left and right as the camera closely pans past our faces. \nElsewhere on the set are John Buffalo Mailer, as Shia's character's best friend, Austin Pendleton, 94-year-old \nEli Wallach and Natalie Morales. Also in this film are: the magnificent Frank Langella, as Shia's boss, who \nthrows himself in front of a train early in the film, Susan Sarandon as Shia's real-estate broker mother, Sylvia \nMiles, who reprises her hilarious cameo as another real-estate agent and Jean Pigozzi as an international \nbanker. \nLunch is called at 4 p.m. and Michael Douglas takes seven heavily made-up and bejeweled women including \nSusan, Jill and me to a restaurant around the corner. Gordon Gekko hosts a hen party talking about children, \nschools, country houses and vacations. \nBack on the set Oliver is shooting the actual dinner. Assistant directors ask for volunteers to dance to the live \nmusic. Prince Dimitri twirls and dips Jackie Weld. Kelly Klein, in her own Karl Lagerfeld sheer black organza, \nwatches from a table with scattered champagne glasses half-filled with apple juice along with her 86-year-old \nfather, Tulley Rector. Charlie Sheen leaves for LA and Shia is very annoyed he was not introduced to his \nhero. Carrie Mulligan, costumed like Audrey Hepburn, chats with us between takes. \nThe final set up is a long tracking shot of Josh Brolin and his wife as they triumphantly enter the ball. It is \nclose to 9 p.m. and Lord William Astor arrives to pick me up for Amalia Dayan and Adam Lindemann's dinner \nfor artists uptown. \nOliver is introduced to William and delights in calling him Lord as he immediately moves him into the top of \nthe shot and instructs him to tell Eli Wallach, \"We must do lunch\". Ever the proper English gentleman, \nWilliam advises Oliver that Lords do not use American slang and improvises his own lines. The tracking shot \ncontinues for numerous takes following Josh and NoeIle as every VIP extra gets another shot at instant stardom \nwith one-line greetings. \nAt last, \"It's a wrap\" is screamed after 10 p.m. Prince Dimitri tells The Wall Street Journal it was, \"a day of \nelectrifying glamour,\" and \"the longest gala of my life. I was in black tie for thirteen hours.\" \nNovember 25, Tommy Gun Salon, Ludlow Street, last day of shooting \nDonald Trump is on set at 7 a.m. ready for his close up. He is trying to make a mid-day departure on his jet \nfrom Teterboro with wife Melania and son Baron for Thanksgiving weekend in Palm Beach. Back in \nSeptember, Oliver had invited Donald Trump to dinner at \"21\" to meet his leading men Josh and Shia so they \ncould observe New York's most charismatic powerbroker in his natural environment. \nThe scene is London so the grey skies are perfect. Gekko has moved abroad to make his financial \ncomeback. The scene opens on the back of his head in a barber's chair as he watches the financial news on TV. \nThe camera pulls back and Gordon Gekko is finally revealed as the powerful bull he once was in an exquisite \nsuit and signature slicked-back hair. Donald Trump walks into the shop for a cut and the banter begins about \nthe money market. From his chair, Donald leans into Michael and suggests a \"comb over\" like his famous \ndo. Gekko, with a slight grin, says, \"No thanks Donald, I am a gel man.\" \nThe crew is yucking it up and Donald feels great. Paparazzi shoot the whole scene with long lenses from across \nthe street. The unit publicist is helpless to keep this under wraps. Donald emerges, poses and gives interviews. \nMichael comes out, and the press think they have a scoop on the ending. Gekko is back in all his lovable titan \nsplendor. Full-page photos of Michael and Donald run the next day in the tabloids. Never underestimate Oliver \nStone's surprise endings. \nTwentieth Century Fox releases \"Wall Street 2: The Money Never Sleeps\" on April 23rd and it's got hit written \nall over it. \n--\n*********************************************************** \nJeffrey Epstein \nincluding all attachments. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 032010 \n\n\n\n2010-01-12 11:18:58\n\nFrom: NA\n\nTo: Peggy Siegal \n\nCC: NA\n\nSubject: Re: My Wall Street 2 Story \n\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 032004\n\nSent: 1/12/2010 11:18:58 AM \nTo: Peggy Siegal \nSubject: Re: My Wall Street 2 Story \nsorry you are sick, go slow., no cleaning, stay in bed.. sorry.. \nOn Tue, Jan 12, 2010 at 6:17 AM, Peggy Siegal -________________________________wrote: \nWill call you later.

I tell him Oliver Stone wants him in \"Wall Street 2\" as an extra. (I make this up.) Graydon \njokes that he only works with lines. I say, \"Not a problem.\" (This will be news to Oliver.) \nBack on the set I tell Oliver that Graydon is willing to be in the film with lines. Oliver finds that intriguing. \nOliver shoots the piano recital scene over and over again from different angles all afternoon. Financial wizard Don Marron \nsaunters on the set to visit and Oliver spontaneously puts him in a scene chatting with Josh. Carrie Mulligan hangs out watching \nboyfriend Shia work. \nAt sundown Julia Koch has to race from reel to real life and explain to her husband where she has been all day. (He loves it.) \nChuck Pfieffer plants a \"Page Six\" item and the next day socialites begin calling me to get into the film. \nThursday, November 5, Shun Lee Restaurant, West 65th Street \nOliver shoots a crowded tight interior scene with Michael, Carrie and Shia, who are having an intimate Chinese dinner. \nSpontaneously, Oliver decides this is the perfect scene for Graydon Carter. After a flurry of calls, Graydon arrives on set, and playing \nhimself, sashays by the table. Gekko jumps up to say hello and Graydon brushes him off with a few dismissive lines. \nMonday, November 9, 25 Broadway \nOne hundred swells show up at the former Canard Shipping building, a massive Italianate hall, at the crack of dawn for the \nAlzheimer's Ball, a grand charity event. \nSusan Hess and I are chauffeured downtown with our Vera Wang gowns and report to the VIP extra holding area where we join \nPrince Dimitri of Yugoslavia in a bespoke dinner jacket, journalist Christopher Mason, songstress Yanna Avis, photographer Kelly \nKlein, art dealer Larry Gagosian's girl friend Shala Monroque in see-through Rodarte, beauty executive Olivia Chantecaille, producer \nLawrence Robins, author Jackie Weld Drake, Vogue film critic Joan Juliet Buck, fashion consultant Jill Fairchild, CNN's Felicia \nTaylor and Italian newsman Mario Calvo-Platero. \nEllen Mirojnick and her costume department have assembled racks of the most expensive elaborate designer gowns and work at \nbreak neck speed styling while we wildly strip to our undies in a makeshift dressing area. Ellen pours me into a black tulle Marchesa \nwith a enormous wired silver bow. Twenty hairdressers and make-up artists systematically work on 250 extras. A mile of tables are \nalternately filled with steaming coffee, fattening breakfast foods, hair sprays, mirrors, shoes and jewelry. It's a madhouse of \nexcitement. \nWe are led to the part of the set used for the cocktail reception and placed around Michael Douglas and Charlie Sheen stand-ins. \nCharlie has been flown in from LA for half a days work to reprise his original character. He is now the highest paid television actor \ncommanding two million dollars an episode of \"Two and a Half Men.\" \nOliver arrives on the set greeting, examining, tweaking the shot and always pulling the prettiest girls closest to the \ncamera. Michael and Charlie arrive from their trailers and run their lines as socials drift into their sight lines challenging their \nconcentration on pages of dialogue. Oliver yells, \"Action\" as the extras aggressively jockey for face time. Charlie is not having an \neasy day and they do take after take. My corporate husband Chuck Pfieffer has gotten his real girlfriend Lisa Crosby in the film and \nmy marriage has become a threesome. \nSensing our concern of not making it onto the silver screen Oliver tells his first assistant director to seat a dinner table with \nSusan Hess, Jill Fairchild, Prince Dimitri, Chuck Pfieffer, Grace Meigher and Mario Calvo-Platero. He directs us to chat with each \nother turning left and right as the camera closely pans past our faces. \nElsewhere on the set are John Buffalo Mailer, as Shia's character's best friend, Austin Pendleton, 94-year-old Eli Wallach and \nNatalie Morales. Also in this film are: the magnificent Frank Langella, as Shia's boss, who throws himself in front of a train early in \nthe film, Susan Sarandon as Shia's real-estate broker mother, Sylvia Miles, who reprises her hilarious cameo as another real-estate \nagent and Jean Pigozzi as an international banker. \nLunch is called at 4 p.m. and Michael Douglas takes seven heavily made-up and bejeweled women including Susan, Jill and me \nto a restaurant around the corner. Gordon Gekko hosts a hen party talking about children, schools, country houses and vacations. \nBack on the set Oliver is shooting the actual dinner. Assistant directors ask for volunteers to dance to the live music. Prince \nDimitri twirls and dips Jackie Weld. Kelly Klein, in her own Karl Lagerfeld sheer black organza, watches from a table with scattered \nchampagne glasses half-filled with apple juice along with her 86-year-old father, Tulley Rector. Charlie Sheen leaves for LA and \nShia is very annoyed he was not introduced to his hero. Carrie Mulligan, costumed like Audrey Hepburn, chats with us between \ntakes. \nThe final set up is a long tracking shot of Josh Brolin and his wife as they triumphantly enter the ball. It is close to 9 p.m. and \nLord William Astor arrives to pick me up for Amalia Dayan and Adam Lindemann's dinner for artists uptown. \nOliver is introduced to William and delights in calling him Lord as he immediately moves him into the top of the shot and \ninstructs him to tell Eli Wallach, \"We must do lunch\". Ever the proper English gentleman, William advises Oliver that Lords do not \nuse American slang and improvises his own lines. The tracking shot continues for numerous takes following Josh and Noelle as \nevery VIP extra gets another shot at instant stardom with one-line greetings. \nAt last, \"It's a wrap\" is screamed after 10 p.m. Prince Dimitri tells The Wall Street Journal it was, \"a day of electrifying \nglamour,\" and \"the longest gala of my life. I was in black tie for thirteen hours.\" \nNovember 25, Tommy Gun Salon, Ludlow Street, last day of shooting \nDonald Trump is on set at 7 a.m. ready for his close up. He is trying to make a mid-day departure on his jet from Teterboro \nwith wife Melania and son Baron for Thanksgiving weekend in Palm Beach. Back in September, Oliver had invited Donald Trump to \ndinner at \"21\" to meet his leading men Josh and Shia so they could observe New York's most charismatic powerbroker in his natural \nenvironment. \nThe scene is London so the grey skies are perfect. Gekko has moved abroad to make his financial comeback. The scene opens \non the back of his head in a barber's chair as he watches the financial news on TV. The camera pulls back and Gordon Gekko is \nfinally revealed as the powerful bull he once was in an exquisite suit and signature slicked-back hair. Donald Trump walks into the \nshop for a cut and the banter begins about the money market. From his chair, Donald leans into Michael and suggests a \"comb over\" \nlike his famous do. Gekko, with a slight grin, says, \"No thanks Donald, I am a gel man.\" \nThe crew is yucking it up and Donald feels great. Paparazzi shoot the whole scene with long lenses from across the street. The \nunit publicist is helpless to keep this under wraps. Donald emerges, poses and gives interviews. Michael comes out, and the press \nthink they have a scoop on the ending. Gekko is back in all his lovable titan splendor. Full-page photos of Michael and Donald run \nthe next day in the tabloids. Never underestimate Oliver Stone's surprise endings. \nTwentieth Century Fox releases \"Wall Street 2: The Money Never Sleeps\" on April 23rd and its got hit written all over it. \n*********************************************************** \nJeffrey Epstein \nincluding all attachments. \n*********************************************************** \nJeffrey Epstein \nincluding all attachments. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 032004 \n\n\n\n2010-07-24 17:10:54\n\nFrom: Daniel Siad \n\nTo: NA\n\nCC: NA\n\nSubject: hello from ibiza \n\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031993\n\nFrom: Daniel Siad \nSent: 7/24/2010 5:10:54 PM \nSubject: hello from ibiza \ncan you come to Ibiza or you can send us the ticket to come with \nTigrane and five girls to Paris because they have there return ticket \nfrom Barcelona if they are living from here \nit will be great if you can arrenge for us tickets for Paris \nplease let me know so we can get orgnized \n&gt; i will be in paris tom000rw night \n&gt; • On Sat Jul 24 2010 at 9:32 AM, Daniel Siad \nwrote: \n»• the other girl name is \n» On Sat, Jul 24, 2010 at 2:28 PM, Daniel Siad &lt; \nwrote: \n&gt;» Can you call me \n&gt;» I am with tigrane he would like to meet you he is here with me in Ibiza \n&gt;» with 8 top girls he said he would like to build some thing with you \n&gt;» can you come to Ibiza we have a huge house or how can we orgnise this \n&gt;» meeting even Jean Luc could doo a great biz also \n&gt;» he has the most amizing top models on stand by I told him not to do any \n&gt;» deals with anybody before he meet with you . \n&gt;» he stoped working with IMG and Trump wi here please call me and let me \n&gt;» know what is your plans \n&gt;» \n&gt;» warmest regards \n&gt;» Daniel \n&gt;» \n&gt;» \n&gt;» On Fri, Jul 23, 2010 at 2:38 PM, Jeffrey Epstein \n&gt;» \n»» what is your schedule? \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; *********************************************************** \n»» The information contained in this communication is \n»» Jeffrey Epstein \n»» including all attachments. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;» --\n&gt;» Confidentiality Notice: The information contained in this electronic \n&gt;» message is PRIVILEGED and confidential information intended only for the \n&gt;» use \n&gt;» of the individual entity or entities named as recipient or recipients.

SCOTT \n\"Inside Job,\" a sleek, briskly paced film whose title suggests a heist movie, is the story of a crime \nwithout punishment, of an outrage that has so far largely escaped legal sanction and societal stigma. The \nbetrayal of public trust and collective values that Mr. Ferguson chronicles was far more brazen and \ndamaging than the adultery in Nathaniel Hawthorne's novel, which treated Hester more as scapegoat than \nvillain. \nThe gist of this movie, which begins in a mood of calm reflection and grows angrier and more incredulous \nas it goes on, is unmistakably punitive. The density of information and the complexity of the subject \nmatter make \"Inside Job\" feel like a classroom lecture at times, but by the end Mr. Ferguson has summoned \nthe scourging moral force of a pulpit-shaking sermon. That he delivers it with rigor, restraint and good \nhumor makes his case all the more devastating. \nHe is hardly alone in making it. Numerous journalists have published books and articles retracing the \npaths that led the world economy to the precipice two years ago. The deregulation of the financial \nservices industry in the 1980s and '90s; the growing popularity of complex and risky derivatives; the \nreal estate bubble and the explosion of subprime lending — none of these developments were exactly \nsecret. On the contrary, they were celebrated as vindications of the power and wisdom of markets. \nAccordingly, Mr. Ferguson recycles choice moments of triumphalism, courtesy of Lawrence H. Summers, \nGeorge W. Bush, Alan Greenspan and various cable television ranters and squawkers. \nEven as stock indexes soared and profits swelled, there were always at least a few investors, economists \nand government officials who warned that the frenzied speculation was leading to the abyss. Some of these \nprophets without honor show up in front of Mr. Ferguson's camera, less to gloat than to present, once \nagain, the analyses that were dismissed and ignored by their peers for so long. \nDozens of interviews — along with news clips and arresting aerial shots of New York, Iceland and other \ndisaster areas — are folded into a clear and absorbing history, narrated by Matt Damon. The music (an \nopening song, \"Big Time,\" by Peter Gabriel, and a score by Alex Heffes) and the clean wide-screen \ncinematography provide an aesthetic polish that is welcome for its own sake and also important to the \nmovie's themes. The handsomely lighted and appointed interiors convey a sense of the rarefied, privileged \nworlds in which the Wall Street operators and their political enablers flourished, and the elegance of \nthe presentation also subliminally bolsters the film's authority. This is not a piece of ragged \nmuckraking or breathless advocacy. It rests its outrage on reason, research and careful argument. \nThe same was true of Mr. Ferguson's previous documentary, \"No End in Sight,\" which focused on \ncatastrophic policies carried out in Iraq by President George W. Bush's administration just after the \noverthrow of Saddam Hussein. But whereas that film concentrated on a narrow view of a complex subject — \nthe conduct of the war rather than the at least equally controversial rationale for fighting it — \"Inside \nJob\" offers a sweeping synthesis, going as far back as the Reagan administration and as far afield as \nIceland in its anatomy of the financial crisis. \nPerhaps unsurprisingly, many of the highest-profile players declined to be interviewed. Mr. Summers \nappears only in news footage, and none of his predecessors or successors as Treasury secretary — not \nRobert E. Rubin or Henry M. Paulson Jr. or Timothy F. Geithner — submit to Mr. Ferguson's questions. Nor \ndo any of the top executives at Goldman Sachs or the other big banks. Most of the interviewees are, at \nleast from the perspective of the filmmaker, friendly witnesses, adding fuel to the director's \ncomprehensive critique of the way business has been done in the United States and the other advanced \ncapitalist countries for the past two decades. \nBoth American political parties are indicted; \"Inside Job\" is not simply another belated settling of \naccounts with Mr. Bush and his advisers, though they are hardly ignored. The scaling back of government \noversight and the weakening of checks on speculative activity by banks began under Reagan and continued \nduring the Clinton administration. And with each administration the market in derivatives expanded, and \nalarms about the dangers of this type of investment were ignored. Raghuram Rajan, chief economist at the \nInternational Monetary Fund, presented a paper in 2005 warning of a \"catastrophic meltdown\" and was \nmocked as a \"Luddite\" by Mr. Summers. \nMeanwhile, some investment bankers — at Goldman Sachs in particular — were betting against the positions \nthey were pushing on their customers. An elaborate house of cards had been constructed in which bad \nconsumer loans were bundled into securities, which, were certified as sound by rating agencies paid by \nthe banks and then insured via credit-default swaps. One risky bet was stacked on top of another, and in \nretrospect the collapse of the whole edifice, along with the loss of jobs, homes, pensions and political \nconfidence, seems inevitable. \nHow did this happen? Mr. Ferguson is no conspiracy theorist; nor is he inclined toward structural or \nsystemic explanations. Markets are not like tectonic plates, shifting on their own. Visible hands write \nlaws and make deals, and in this case a combination of warped values and groupthink seems to have driven \nvery intelligent men (and they were mostly men) toward folly. In addition to business and government, Mr. \nFerguson aims his critique at academia, suggesting that the discipline of economics and more than a few \nprominent economists were corrupted by consulting fees, seats on boards of directors and membership in \nthe masters of the universe club. \nwhen he challenges some of these professors, in particular those who held positions of responsibility in \nthe white House or in the Federal Reserve, they are reduced to stammering obfuscation — markets are \ncomplicatedl Who could have predicted? I don't see any conflict of interest — and occasionally provoked \nto testiness. Mr. Ferguson, for his part, cannot always contain his incredulity or rein in his sarcasm. \noccasionally his voice pipes up from off camera, saying things like, \"You can't be serious!\" \nBut it is hard to imagine a movie more serious, and more urgent, than \"Inside Job.\" There are a few \navenues that might have been explored more thoroughly, in particular the effects of the crisis on \nordinary, non-wall-street-connected workers and homeowners. The end of the film raises a disturbing \nquestion, as Mr. Damon exhorts viewers to demand changes in the status quo so that the trends associated \nwith unchecked speculation of the kind that caused the last crisis — rising inequality, neglect of \nproductive capacity, endless cycles of boom and bust — might be reversed. \nThis call to arms makes you wonder why anger of the kind so eloquently expressed in \"Inside Job\" has been \nso inchoate. And through no fault of its own, the film may leave you dispirited as well as enraged. Its \nfate is likely to be that of other documentaries: praised in some quarters, nitpicked in others and \nshrugged off by those who need its message most. Which is a shame. \n\"Inside Job\" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Some drug and sex references and pervasive \nobscenity, though not the verbal kind. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031989 \n\n\n\n2011-02-06 21:35:06\n\nFrom: \n\nTo: \n\nCC: NA\n\nSubject: Re: You should see this movie/documentary \n\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031987\n\nFrom: \nSent: 2/6/2011 9:35:06 PM \nSubject: Re: You should see this movie/documentary \nseems very one-sided and as if the makers didn't quite see the bigger picture \ni'm not sure the finance industry really had too much of a choice \n-----Original Message----- \nTo: \nSent: Sun, Feb 6, 2011 5:27 am \nSubject: Re: You should see this movie/documentary \nit is very unfair, and misrepresents tons of inf \nOn Sun, Feb 6, 2011 at 3:26 AM, wrote: \nInside Job (2010) \nNYT Critics' PickThis movie has been designated a Critic's Pick by the film reviewers of The New York \nTimes. \nSony Pictures Classics \nHenry Paulson, Ben Bernanke and Timothy Geithner in the documentary \"Inside Job.\" \nWho Maimed the Economy, and How \nBy A. 0.

The mix of adventure, relaxation and truly experiencing a destination are hallmarks of Travaasa. With the beauty of Hana, Hawaii, all around, it's hard to imagine a better marriage of purpose and place.

Sitting on 50 wild acres of jungle by the beach, this striking Italian-style villa has white sand-colored interiors that match the serene beach outside. The Duchess of Ferrari originally built this tropical hideaway on Mexico's fabled Yucatan Peninsula in the early 1990s to entertain her globetrotting friends. It has since been remade as a 29-room boutique wonder, where that local culture is so intrinsic to the design that it can be found in the minutest details.

All 10 suites were individually designed by Enrique Zozaya in a sleek, modern-tropical style and capture the unspoiled views on private terraces and balconies. With the soaring Sierra Madre del Sur mountains in the distance and sleepy fishing village of Barra de Potosi close by, the Hotel Las Palmas is a true barefoot hideaway in a quintessentially Mexican setting.

It's the sixth largest city in California (with nearly half a million people), one half of the western hemisphere's largest port, and it's finally coming into its own as a magnet for travelers. The modern, 138-room AVIA Hotel sits at the epicenter of all the action. And the cheery Long Beach lovers staffing the property are happy to highlight the best of the city.

With its family-friendly vibe, Turnberry Isle falls somewhere between Grossinger's in the Catskills (at its legendary height) and a posh island resort.

Guests hop on bicycles, bound down the river in rafts, clamber into 4x4s, and, of course, hike into some of the most jaw-dropping geology on the planet. Evenings are as relaxing as the days are active, with a fixed homebase - a lodge set against red-rock cliffs that happens to have its own winery.

the travel world, but we're taking it seriously to heart this week at Jetsetter. The \"new\" is the Dream Downtown NYC, a hip, reinvented space at the crossroads of Chelsea and the Meatpacking District (MePa, if you really must). The \"noteworthy\" is a little thing called skydiving at Mount Everest. Whether it's lounging poolside in New York or jumping out of a plane in full view of the world's highest mountain, there's a lot going on this week. Read on for all the details, including properties in Paris, San Francisco, Vegas, Miami and more. (Image: Skydive Mount Everest - on sale Sat, Aug 6.)                         Hip Manhattan Newcomer... with Real Sand     &lt;http://cdn.jetsetter.com/static/templates/mktg/lt-gray-pixel.gif&gt;     Dream Downtown - NYC     &lt;http://click.mail.jetsetter.com/?qs=b729e29fef3ecc26669f0079f97f4b05246b2e0bd645fcdcbb33823945d94c9dbc460605a6f14795&gt;            The new Dream Downtown has the best of both worlds. Housed in a 1960s building designed by Albert C. Ledner, it's situated at the crux of Manhattan's art, design and nightlife scenes between Chelsea and the Meatpacking District. With a hot rooftop bar, a Miami-meets-Ibiza pool (with lounge chairs set in real sand) and modern rooms with classic Downtown views, you can have your party and a good night's sleep, too.

Designer Aurélia Santoni fashioned this intimate boutique property with eccentricity and flair; lampshades from Dutch design firm Moooi hang above Utrecht armchairs in the lobby. Above all, the style of the guestrooms and the service stress comfort; Mon feels like your personal Paris pied-à-terre.

Although the property lacks the charm of smaller hotels, it more than compensates with its amenities, which include tennis courts and seven pools. The highlight is the vast thalassotherapy spa, which underwent a multimillion-dollar renovation in 2008.

As far removed from the sun and sand of the touristy Algarve as you can get, this is a destination for the discerning traveler and the lover of fine things, whether they be cigars, hand-painted silk wallpaper, the country's best spa or a championship golf course.

Built in 1937 and completely renovated three years ago, the hotel is home to a hip-again Bauhaus style in the comfortable rooms and gourmet dining at on-site Baraka Restaurant. For exploring, you can't beat the location: It's a short walk to restaurants, parks, museums and the city's famed thermal baths.

In Zermatt, a legendary ski village where the Matterhorn (\"Horu\" to locals) dominates the landscape (and the activities, yearround) the hotel has the requisite majestic views. But modern interiors and quirky accents like antlers and cheerful checkerboard patterns make the Cervo a study in Swiss chic.

Best of all, it's within walking distance from some of the city's top attractions like Union Square, North Beach and Chinatown.

The \"new\" is the Dream Downtown NYC, a hip, reinvented space at the crossroads of Chelsea and the Meatpacking District (MePa, if you really must). The \"noteworthy\" is a little thing called skydiving at Mount Everest. Whether it's lounging poolside in New York or jumping out of a plane in full view of the world's highest mountain, there's a lot going on this week. Read on for all the details, including properties in Paris, San Francisco, Vegas, Miami and more.

Housed in a 1960s building designed by Albert C. Ledner, it's situated at the crux of Manhattan's art, design and nightlife scenes between Chelsea and the Meatpacking District. With a hot rooftop bar, a Miami-meets-Ibiza pool (with lounge chairs set in real sand) and modern rooms with classic Downtown views, you can have your party and a good night's sleep, too. \n \n\nClick here to visit sale &lt;http://click.mail.jetsetter.com/?qs=b729e29fef3ecc2660e0a8583339a2d82e40c041cff1bda9b7e6372fd5bad85465c946022fc4cd0a&gt;        \nNow Live\n\n \n &lt;http://click.mail.jetsetter.com/?qs=21a04b983bc3ed3138a30f0cacf52fbf0d1d5675e6461edb6e160b95676b5c9f5b2e5908a0706189&gt;  \n \n    \n     &lt;http://cdn.jetsetter.com/static/templates/mktg/10px_lt-gray-pixel.gif&gt; \n \n    \n    \nRomance by the Arc de Triomphe\n\n \n &lt;http://cdn.jetsetter.com/static/templates/mktg/lt-gray-pixel.gif&gt; \n \n\nMon Hotel - Paris\n\n \n &lt;http://click.mail.jetsetter.com/?qs=21a04b983bc3ed3158e427404c99b10635d18fd87351d3be9f6540ad8a7d661c65871c8e749b24b9&gt;  \n \n    \n    Just a short walk from the Arc de Triomphe, Mon Hotel sits on a quiet street off the bustling boulevards.

Through gaps in the greenery \nappear stone fountains, elephant statues, pools the size of tennis complexes \n(next to actual tennis complexes), and more clay roofs than one could count. \nIt's a monumental display of wealth, and it is rapidly expanding, not just \nhere but in Delray Beach, Jupiter, Palm Beach Gardens and Boca Raton, as \nmoney pours out of the Northeast (and in some cases, from as far as London \nand Singapore) and into this already wealthy section of southeast Florida. \nApproximately 70 hedge and private equity funds are now headquartered \nhere, many of which have set up shop in the last two years, jacking up home \nprices and spurring a countywide initiative to become, as some have said, \n\"the new Greenwich.\" \nFor hedge fund managers who might normally be inclined toward \nWestchester or Connecticut, the allure of South Florida is as plain as grits \non toast. The homes are sprawling; the Intracoastal Waterway is a yachter's \nparadise. It has a glittering social scene. During high season—October \nthrough March—there might be several fundraisers on any given night. \nPerhaps the key factor, however: In Florida, there are no individual income \ntaxes, no estate taxes and no capital gains taxes. A hedge fund manager \nreporting $1 million in income can expect to pay only the federal \ngovernment, whereas his counterpart living in Connecticut pays that plus an \nextra $67,000. And if the poor schmuck were still in New York City? He'd \nbetter be ready to fork over $104,300. \nAs for why all of this is happening now, when Florida has long been a sunny \ntax haven, so to speak, financiers point to the upcoming application of \nSection 457A of the Internal Revenue Code. Before 457A was enacted, \ncertain fees and related earnings could grow tax deferred in offshore \naccounts for up to ten years. But now, according to the section, hedge fund \nmanagers will need to funnel all of the fees that were deferred before 2009 \nand their related earnings back into the U.S. by 2017. If a manager lives in \nFlorida when this happens, he's much less likely to pay exorbitant state \ntaxes on the whole amount. If he still lived in New York City? \nFuggedaboudit. \nIt's the job of Kelly Smallridge, president and CEO of the Palm Beach \nBusiness Development Board, to ensure that hedge fund and private equity \nmanagers are informed of these benefits, in the hopes that they, and their \nfirms, will become Palm Beach County's newest residents. She's developed a \nred-carpet tour that goes beyond looking at office space and real estate to \ninclude meeting headmasters at private schools, the school-district \nsuperintendent and the mayor and speaking with the governor's staff and \nCEOs who have moved their operations here. Plus, of course, a few nights \non the town. \nIn the winter, when the well-to-do from all over the Northeast visit Florida \nfor charity balls, the board hosts dinners and parties for prospective \nrelocators and local captains of industry. Last year, Smallridge and \ncompany sponsored a soiree aboard a $70 million yacht that featured Veuve \nClicquot, caviar and live jazz. Guests—who included the CEOs of a national \nIT company, a major finance company and a land developer, venture \ncapitalists, hedge fund managers and the creator of Goldman Sachs' prime \nbrokerage division—took private tours with the captain of the yacht. \nSmallridge is also working with former hedge fund CIO Dr. Rainford Knight \nto develop a club for local investment managers called SocialAlpha that \nencourages bankers in Palm Beach County's ritzy social scene to get to know \neach other. Even Florida governor Rick Scott has gotten involved, sending \npersonal letters to friends and prospects from the Northeast (the governor is \na former Greenwich resident and businessman) to convince them of \nFlorida's merits. \nSmallridge and Governor Scott are hoping to induce a snowball effect, and \nso far, it seems to be working. Every financier who moves south chips away \nat the primary reason to remain near New York City—the fact that everyone \nelse is there. That's not to say it's been easy. Florida is still Florida, and \npopular opinion has not been kind. Even Palm Beach, which has for the \nmost part dodged the insults hurled at the rest of the state, is known for its \nresidents' apocalyptically bad driving and worse Hawaiian shirts. \n\"There was a fair amount of trepidation,\" says Al Rabil III, managing \npartner and CEO of Kayne Anderson Real Estate Advisors, who made the \nmove from Armonk, New York, with 20 coworkers this summer. \"But once \neverybody got past the stereotypes and actually came and looked, that \nchanged.\" He says most of his employees weren't looking for bottle service \nand models anyway. The majority of those who have reached the upper \nechelons of financial management are married with children, and the appeal \nof a semi-tropical paradise with luxury restaurants, year-round recreation, \nand sophisticated socializing in a community far more tight-knit than \nManhattan (yes, that'sDonald Trump over there) is not lost on them. \nPorter's tour of Billionaire's Row was part of a modified version of one of \nthe Business Development Board's red-carpet tours that I took as part of \nresearching this story. I ate breakfast at the clubby Top of the Point \nrestaurant with some of the area's prominent financiers. A waiter in a \ncaptain's outfit served lobster rolls while a CPA, a lawyer and the executive \ndirector of the Palm Beach County Education Commission touted the area's \nbenefits. I surveyed real estate and office space surrounded by miles of \nwater without once having my foot stepped on by a tourist. You can see how \nall this might sway someone who's on the fence. \nExploring the sugary beaches of South Florida, one starts to wonder why \nWall Streeters would be on the fence at all. Between the smiling locals and \nthe shopping on Worth Avenue, the Hiaasen-esque stereotypes recede. \nWhat remains are the facts: Take-home pay is higher, commutes are \nshorter, and it's just as fabulous as Manhattan, at least for four months of \nthe year. Meanwhile, no one in Florida even owns an ice scraper. With the \nInternet allowing more and more money managers to perform their work \nfrom nearly anywhere, there are few reasons not to make the move. \n\"Initially, it was a way to play golf and keep the wife and kids happy,\" says \nBrett Langbert, managing director and head of sales at I.A. Englander & Co. \n\"But once we moved down, it became a quality-of-life issue. There are \nunlimited things the kids can do outside. I have to tell you, my wife and I \nare so happy we haven't had to go to one of those indoor bouncy-castle \nplaces since we got here.\" \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 033161 \n\n\n\n2014-01-21 22:51:27\n\nFrom: \n\nTo: ; Subotnick Stuart 11111111111111111111&gt;; Prosperi Paul \n\nCC: NA\n\nSubject: Fwd: Why Palm Beach, Florida Is The 'New Greenwich' For Wall Streeters \n\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 033562\n\nFrom: \nSent: 1/21/2014 10:51:27 PM \nSubject: Fwd: Why Palm Beach, Florida Is The 'New Greenwich' For Wall Streeters \n-----Original Message----- \nFrom: BRYAN SUBOTNICK 411111111111&gt; \nTo: ; Subotnick Stuart 11111111111111111111&gt;; Prosperi Paul \nSent: Tue, Jan 21, 2014 4:35 pm \nSubject: Why Palm Beach, Florida Is The 'New Greenwich' For Wall Streeters \nFINANCE \nWhy Palm Beach, Florida Is The 'New Greenwich' For Wall Streeters \nJACQUELINE DETWILER, DUJOUR \nJAN. 21, 2014, 1:18 PM \nNeilson Barnard/Getty Images \nThe Palm Beach finance crowd can paddleboard whenever they please. \nBehind a semicircular brick drive and a lawn as manicured as a putting green sits a 30,000-square-foot \nmasterpiece of Italian Renaissance architecture called Casa Nana. \nJohn Porter, a real estate associate for Corcoran who oversees some of the largest sales in Palm Beach \nCounty, Florida, points out the spiral staircase, built by famed 1920s architect Addison Mizner for the \nfounder of the National Tea Company. \"This home went for $30.2 million in 2003; today that sum wouldn't \nbe in the top 25 highest prices\" of houses for sale in this area, Porter says. \"Palm Beach real estate \nhas gone from nothing going on to nothing left to sell.\" \nPorter is giving me a tour of the so-called Billionaire's Row, a stretch of South Ocean Boulevard on the \nisland of Palm Beach that is bordered by some of the highest hedges I've ever seen.

Even Florida governor Rick Scott has gotten involved, sending personal letters \nto friends and prospects from the Northeast (the governor is a former Greenwich resident and businessman) \nto convince them of Florida's merits. \nSmallridge and Governor Scott are hoping to induce a snowball effect, and so far, it seems to be working. \nEvery financier who moves south chips away at the primary reason to remain near New York City—the fact \nthat everyone else is there. That's not to say it's been easy. Florida is still Florida, and popular \nopinion has not been kind. Even Palm Beach, which has for the most part dodged the insults hurled at the \nrest of the state, is known for its residents' apocalyptically bad driving and worse Hawaiian shirts. \n\"There was a fair amount of trepidation,\" says Al Rabil III, managing partner and CEO of Kayne Anderson \nReal Estate Advisors, who made the move from Armonk, New York, with 20 coworkers this summer. \"But once \neverybody got past the stereotypes and actually came and looked, that changed.\" He says most of his \nemployees weren't looking for bottle service and models anyway. The majority of those who have reached \nthe upper echelons of financial management are married with children, and the appeal of a semi-tropical \nparadise with luxury restaurants, year-round recreation, and sophisticated socializing in a community far \nmore tight-knit than Manhattan (yes, that'sDonald Trump over there) is not lost on them. \nPorter's tour of Billionaire's Row was part of a modified version of one of the Business Development \nBoard's red-carpet tours that I took as part of researching this story. I ate breakfast at the clubby Top \nof the Point restaurant with some of the area's prominent financiers. A waiter in a captain's outfit \nserved lobster rolls while a CPA, a lawyer and the executive director of the Palm Beach County Education \nCommission touted the area's benefits. I surveyed real estate and office space surrounded by miles of \nwater without once having my foot stepped on by a tourist. You can see how all this might sway someone \nwho's on the fence. \nExploring the sugary beaches of South Florida, one starts to wonder why Wall Streeters would be on the \nfence at all. Between the smiling locals and the shopping on Worth Avenue, the Hiaasen-esque stereotypes \nrecede. What remains are the facts: Take-home pay is higher, commutes are shorter, and it's just as \nfabulous as Manhattan, at least for four months of the year. Meanwhile, no one in Florida even owns an \nice scraper. With the Internet allowing more and more money managers to perform their work from nearly \nanywhere, there are few reasons not to make the move. \n\"Initially, it was a way to play golf and keep the wife and kids happy,\" says Brett Langbert, managing \ndirector and head of sales at I.A. Englander & Co. \"But once we moved down, it became a quality-of-life \nissue. There are unlimited things the kids can do outside. I have to tell you, my wife and I are so happy \nwe haven't had to go to one of those indoor bouncy-castle places since we got here.\" \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 033562 \n\n\n\n2014-06-07 16:45:54\n\nFrom: \n\nTo: Larry Visoski &lt; &gt; \n\nCC: NA\n\nSubject: Fwd: Photos \n\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 033497\n\nFrom: \nSent: 6/7/2014 4:45:54 PM \nSubject: Fwd: Photos \n----------MB_SD1508714B7E628_F4C_19E348_webmail-d292.sysops.aol.com \nContent-Transfer-Encoding: QUOTED-PRINTABLE \nContent-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; \ncharset=us-ascii \nJeffrey, \nphotos of unmasked B727,.

BG responded that he thought that \nit must have been true that in ancient times people \nhad been born with a sixth sense. The one \nenabling individuals to have the ability \nto recognize and the seize opportunities. Though \nfew of those individuals remain I think I am one of \nthe fortunate few. He didn't mentioned the horrors \nor the sacrifice of the 48' war. I believe \nMenachem Begin had it,as several years after the \nbitter 73' war he was able to make a daring \npeace with Egypt. Als lzhak Rabin,who now 20yrs \nago, signed the Peace treaty with Jordan though \nin amidst a wave of terror. He faced huge internal \nrejection but it began the first baby steps towards \na settlement with the Palestinians. As we all know \nhe was assassinated by a Jewish terrorist. These \nleaders all faced many risks, yet were able to see \nand seize an opportunity. Statesmanship and \nleadership.. \nDuring the last three years we have been living \nthrough a geo political earthquake. The world \norder, which existed since the demise of the \nOttoman Empire, is collapsing.The Arab Spring \nappears to have turned into an Islamist Winter. \nBorders are erased. Old tribal and sectarian \ndisputes have awakened. In perfect storm like \nfashion Israel now finds itself surrounded by \nclashes of civilizations, in addition to the Islam \nconfrontation between fanatic terror and moderna, \nSuna and Shia, the legacy threats: Iran, Assad in \nSyria, Hezbullah in Lebanon,Hamas in Gaza are \nall still active and worrying. \nwe have to be alert and ready to strongly respond \nto any threat to our security.. \nBut I believe new opportunities are there for the \ntaking. This opportunity,which might not occur \nagain for generations ,is the potential to reshape \nour relationships with the Arab Moderates based \non our common concerns. Extremism, Terror and \nIran. This could open the gate to a more peaceful \nMiddle East based on cooperation and synergies \nrather than blood and revenge. However thers is, \nin my opnion n o way to achieve but to move \nforward with the Palestinians \nA precondition to seize such an opportunity is a \nmighty, sober, self confident Israel, in strong \nalliance with the US. An Israel which can deter or \ndefeat any combination of regional powers, yet, an \nIsrael who is ready to contemplate and consider a \nmodified Saudi or Arab League Plan as a basis for \nnegotiations. \nThe unique relationship we have developed with \nthe US over the last 45yrs based on common \nvalues ,mutual respect and shared interests is a \ncornerstone of our strength, world posture and \nour future. It is also a crucial building block of any \nregional peace and cooperation strategy.Allowing \nIL/US relations to remain damaged, I believe is a \ngrave mistake with potentially far reaching \nconsequences. \nAs the Minister of Defense of Israel I've met more \nthan once with President Obama , as well as with \nPresident Bush before him„ reiterating with both \nthat the though the US is clearly our best friend \nand ally, Israel is a Sovereign state and when our \nsecurity and the future of Israel and the Jewish \npeople are at stake we might need to take \ntough decisions on our own. We cannot and will \nnot, I added, delegate the responsibility for such \ndecisions to even our best friends ,. We respect \nthe fact that we might have different views. \nAmerican Presidents have always understood that \n. We also must have the same respect when the \nUS decides it is its interest to take decisions we \nmight not fully agree with. \nthis relation is of course not fully symmetric. It is \nthe US which will provides Israel with the new F-\n35s and ensures the Qualitative Edge of the IDF \nvis a vis any combination of neighbors. It is the \nUS who significantly financed the Iron Dome, \nArrow and David's Sling missile defense systems. \nIt is the US that has commited to defend Israel in \nthe event of a missile attack from Iran. \nWe should never forget it. \nThe recent spurt of verbal exchanges is a \nworrying signal that something has gone wrong. It \nneeds corrrection.. Netanyahu is not a coward. \nI've seen him as a young special forces \nofficer ,under my command, facing fire directly and \ntaking risks to his life. A very courageous soldier. \nThat will never change. cheap words serve little \npurpose .The same applies to President Obama \nand Secretary Kerry. they are not enemies of \nIsrael. they are Good Friends. Kerry has exhibited \ndecades long support for Israel. Since he became \nSecretary of State he has invested his time \nenergy and prestige trying to help Israel and the \nPalestinians to bridge disputes and reach a \nbreakthrough. it was a noble effort which \nshould justify thanks rather than accustations. We \nare of course concerned by the lack of outcome of \nthe P5+1 negotiations with Iran and we think that \nthe chemical weapons removal from Syria could \nhave been handled differently But President \nObama strengthens the legacy of Presidential \nsupport for Israel.. Israel has a vital interest in \nresuming the healthy trust, and mutual respect \nthat existed until recently. \n. I believe that the most profound internal debate \ninside Israel today is in regard to the relationship \nbetween Israel's security needs and the viability of \nthe \"two states solution\". We all agree that we are \nliving in a tough, merciless and highly \nunpredictable neighborhood..So it is clear that our \nsecurity needs are of the highest priority and we \nshould build certain \"safety margins\" into any \nfuture security planning.But the Israeli Right is \ngoing too far by arguing that the security needs of \nIsrael renders any viable,demilitarized \nindependent, Palestinian State - impossible. \nIn other words, the \" lesson\" of recent years \naccording to our Right is that Israel's Security and \nthe \"two states solution\" are incompatible. I believe \nthis is a fallacious conclusion, driven by narrow \npolitical interests. \nI've served a lifetime career, fighting and \ndefending my country's security. Most of the time \nin uniform. Based on this experience ,I confidently \nconclude,and it is a professional rather than \npolitical answer, that if and when a Palestinian \ndemilitarized independent State will be established \nside by side with Israel behind borders which will \nconsist of a solid Jewish majority for generations \nto come and will include the major \"Settlement \nBlocks\" accompanied by mutually agreed swaps \nand an Israeli long term military presence along \nthe River Jordan - the IDF and the \nSecurityServices will be capable \nof defending Israel. Moreover, I'm confident that \nif we will bring together all former Israeli Chiefs of \nStaff, all former Commanders of the Central \nCommand( responsible for Judea and Samaria) \nand all former Heads of Intelligence ,SecServices \nand Mossad, an extremely vast majority of them \nwill agree with me on this issue. True,it might take \ntime, frustrations and setbacks. It might have to go \nthrough prolonged periods of interim \narrangements. but the IDF is much superior to any \nconceivable rival and will be able to defend Israel \nunder all those circumstances. \nthe Right argument is convoluted, the opposite is \ntrue. The real big threat to the Zionist Project is not \nthe \"two state solution\" but rather the \"one state \nsolution\" which will lead inevitably to either a non \nJewish or a non democratic, potentially ever \nbleeding State. Still,this is the vision the Israeli \nextreme Right shares unknowingly with the Hamas \n(and with all due differences with the lunatic, Post \nZionist fringes of the Israeli Left). \nIn order to seize the opportunity for regional peace \nand cooperation arrangements and in order to \nblock the deterioration towards \"one state solution\" \naction, tenacity and decisiveness will be essential. \npolitics of survival, anxiety and pessimism will not \ndo. \nwe are facing a moment of truth. a time for daring \ndecisions.The essence of Zionism, its raison d'être \nhad always been to take our fate in our hands. \nmake decisions and follow them with actions, \nrather than being dragged by events and decisions \nof others and paying the price for it. \nour legendary Foreign Minister Abba Eban \nfamously said that the Palestinians had never \nmissed an opportunity to miss an opportunity. Lets \nnot fall into the same trap. \nOn Wed, Oct 29, 2014 at 7:12 PM, Nil Priell Barak \nherewith the Op Ed.

His entourage also included two \nwomen who allegedly worked as \"madams\" for Epstein, luring teenaged girls into sex trysts with the tycoon \nand his powerful and famous friends. \nAccording to The ENQUIRER's investigation, Bill spent the day playing golf at a seven-star hotel -- and then was \ninvited to dine with Brunei's sultan, Hassanal Bolkiah .....who was charged with holding a deeply-religious \nChristian beauty queen as a \"human chattel.\" Far from being embarrassed by the ruler's tawdry \nreputation, moreover, records for Bill's nonprofit foundation reveal that Brunei made a donation towards his \nClinton Presidential Library that year of between $1. million and $5 million. \nPlease kindly attempt to provide any comment by 4 pm ET tomorrow, Friday January 30th to Lachlan \nCartwright, Executive Editor, at [Office] or \nThank You, \nPatricia Gonzalez \nThe National Enquirer \nOffice# \nE-mail: \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031995 \n\n\n\n2015-03-24 16:56:34\n\nFrom: \n\nTo: NA\n\nCC: NA\n\nSubject: Re: \n\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 032219\n\nFrom: \nSent: 3/24/2015 4:56:34 PM \nSubject: Re: \nImportance: High \nI wish I had a reason to go to Paris this weekend.

He says he's the \"most successful \nperson ever to run for the presidency, by far.\" (George Washington and Dwight Eisenhower, sit down!) But if there is an \nidea animating his candidacy, it is that the United States is being badly beaten by its economic competitors. In his speech \non foreign policy this week, Trump explained that America is being bested by countries such as China, Japan and Mexico \nbecause their leaders are \"smarter, more cunning and sharper than our leaders.\" \"They're killing us,\" he often says. \nThis is an odd moment to make these charges because the reality is almost entirely the opposite. The United States is \nmore dominant on the global economic landscape than at any point since the heyday of Bill Clinton's presidency — \nperhaps even more so. \nLast quarter, the U.S. economy grew at a 3.7 percent clip. Annual growth now is almost twice that of Europe and four \ntimes that of Japan. Unemployment is at 5.1 percent, the lowest in seven years. The deficit as a percentage of gross \ndomestic product (2.8 percent in 2014) is at its lowest since 2007. \n\"The U.S. has come out of the 2008 crisis better than all the others,\" says Ruchir Sharma, head of global macro investing \nat Morgan Stanley. \"Americans have reduced their debt burden more than the Europeans, while China's debt has \nskyrocketed to extremely dangerous levels. If you look outside of China, U.S. growth is actually faster even than the \nemerging markets. Since the 2008 crisis, U.S. equity markets have outperformed all others — in fact 9 out of the 10 most \nvaluable companies in the world are now American. The dollar is the currency of choice. Global growth is not what it \nused to be, but in a bad neighborhood, the U.S. has the best house by far.\" Sharma points out that for the past four \nyears, the United States' share of global GDP has increased while Europe's and Japan's have moved down. \nWhen I was in Europe last week, businessmen there were concerned with what they saw as a new level of U.S. \ndominance in everything from technology to entertainment to finance. Consider America's big banks. They were at the \nepicenter of the financial crisis and were badly battered by it. Since then, bankers have complained that they've faced \nuncertainty about government policies, overzealous regulators trying to compensate for their laxness before the crisis \nand the unwieldy burdens of the Dodd-Frank law. \nWell, U.S. banks today are more dominant than ever. The Wall Street Journal notes that in the past five years, JPMorgan \nChase, Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have increased in value by $254.6 billion. In the \nsame period, their European competitors, Barclays, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, UBS and Royal Bank of Scotland added \njust $9.5 billion. In July, Barclays Chairman John McFarlane was asked if America's banks were eating European lenders' \nlunch. He replied: \"They are doing a good job of it.\" He added that the U.S. banks \"are the only ones that really claim to \nbe global and successful.\" \nTo compare the United States' performance and leadership to Mexico's, Japan's and China's is particularly ill-timed. \nTrump might be stuck in a 1980s time warp on Japan. When his \"The Art of the Deal\" was published in 1987, Americans \nwere envious of Japan's brilliant leaders, who were said to be outsmarting the United States at every turn. Since then, \nJapan has become the poster child for economic stagnation and political paralysis. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has been \nunwilling or unable to get his promised reforms enacted, and the country's economy continues to shrink. \nMexico is watching its growth collapse. While its president, Enrique Pena Nieto, is a courageous and intelligent leader \nwho has made some very bold decisions, he has also made some significant missteps. Most important, the country was \nill-prepared for plunging oil prices that have battered government revenues and growth. \nChina has had three decades of supercharged growth and competent government policy. But in the past few years, \nBeijing went on a borrowing binge, running up its total debt to levels that are unprecedented, according to Sharma. And \nin the past two months it has made mistakes in managing both its equity markets and currency — mistakes that have \ncost $400 billion, the Financial Times reports. \nOf course, the United States has problems that are worrying, such as wage stagnation and low labor-force participation. \nBut the important comparison is not to some ideal fantasy of what America might be but to other countries in the real \nworld. And the facts show, Mr. Trump, we're killing them. \nNOTE: This e-mail message is subject to the Dubai World Group disclaimer see http://www.dubaiworld.ae/email disclaimer \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 033483 \n\n\n\n2015-12-16 01:00:36\n\nFrom: Michael Wolff \n\nTo: NA\n\nCC: NA\n\nSubject: Heads up \n\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 032228\n\nFrom: Michael Wolff \nSent: 12/16/2015 1:00:36 AM \nSubject: Heads up \nImportance: High \nI hear CNN planning to ask Trump tonight about his relationship with you--either on air or in scrum afterwards. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 032228 \n\n\n\n2015-12-16 16:26:32\n\nFrom: Michael Wolff \n\nTo: NA\n\nCC: NA\n\nSubject: Re: Heads up \n\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 032229\n\nFrom: Michael Wolff \nSent: 12/16/2015 4:26:32 PM \nSubject: Re: Heads up \nImportance: High \nI think you should let him hang himself If he says he hasn't been on the plane or to the house, then that gives \nyou a valuable PR and political currency.

Air Force One \nView this email in your browser here. \nChart of the Day - Economy and Society \nJune 27, 2016 \nDear Barry, \nWhen it comes to describing Donald Trump's private jet, the word \n\"impressive\" would be an understatement. The presumptive Republican Party \nnominee bought the Boeing 757-200 from Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen \nand he spared no expense kitting it out. Dubbed \"Trump Force One,\" the \nluxurious jet is equipped with a shower, gold-plated seatbelt buckles and a \n52-inch flatscreen with a library of 1,000 movies. Built in 1991, the 757 is \nestimated to have cost approximately $100 million. If Trump reaches the \nWhite House in November, he'll have to exchange his personal jet for the \npresidential fleet, two highly modified Boeing 747-200Bs. The aircraft used by \nthe president were built in 1986 and operate with the Air Force One callsign \nwhen the president is onboard. Will switching jets prove one of Trump's few \nregrets if he becomes president? \nEven though it cannot boast gold-plated accessories, Air Force One is a \nlarger aircraft, seating 70 passengers in comfort compared to Trump Force \n..11141, \nOne's 43. The presidential jet is also slightly faster with a range of about \n6,800 nautical miles compared to 4,100 for a 757. A VC-25A can also be \nrefuelled in mid-air by a tanker, extending its range even further. \nThe two presidential planes cost $325 million each and their cost of operation \ncomes to $179,750 per hour. The hourly cost of operation for a standard 757 \nis just over $8,000 by comparison, though the taxpayer will pick up the higher \nbill for Air Force One. All that bling certainly inflated the cost of Trump Force \nOne but Air Force One is expensive because it's packed with equipment and \nfacilities to keep the president and his or her entourage safe at all times. \nThere is a hospital onboard, electronic countermeasures and heavy shielding \nto afford protection in the event of an electromagnetic pulse during a nuclear \nattack. All in all, if Trump does end up travelling regularly on Air Force One, \nhe probably won't regret trading in his gold seatbelt buckle for the presidential \nsuite on one of the most sophisticated airliners in the world. \nhttps://www.statista.com/chart/5110/trump-force-one-vs-air-force-one/ \n+++ Advertisement ++ \n6 Best Practices for Creating Effective Dashboards \nIf you're not using interactive dashboards to make fast data-driven decisions, \nyou're missing out!

Dennis &lt; \nDate: Wed, Nov 9, 2016 at 10:14 AM \nSubject: Responding to yesterday's election \nTo: \n&gt; \nDear Packer Families, \nLike many of you, I am writing this message on very little sleep. Last night was like no other in our \npolitical memory, defying the predictions of the most erudite pundits and political \nprognosticators. \nToday, we are spending a great deal of time unpacking the election results with our students \nacross the three divisions — during morning meeting and throughout the day in Lower School \nclassrooms, in Middle School advisories, during Upper School Community time, as well as in \nmany individual classroom conversations. I write to assure you that we will do our best to handle \nthese discussions with balance, sensitivity, and fairness. \nGiven that last week's mock election among Packer's Upper School students showed that over \n8o% favored Secretary Clinton, I don't think it's a huge leap to assume that there was more \ndisappointment than joy in Packer households as results unfolded last night. At the same time, \nthere are certainly Packer families who support Mr. Trump and are pleased with this outcome. As \na school community, we have an obligation to recognize that there will be a broad array of feelings \ngenerated by the election results, and it is our responsibility as a school to make space for these \nfeelings to be expressed thoughtfully and compassionately, as well as to model the tolerance and \nacceptance of difference that are among our core values. No doubt, we have our work cut out for \nus, but I am confident in the good that we can do as a community. \nThere are abundant lessons to be learned from this election: that experts can be wrong; that our \ncountry is even more deeply divided than many of us had thought; and that abundant numbers of \nour fellow Americans feel a deep sense of despair and disaffection with the status quo of \ngovernment. For us here at school, we will use this as an opportunity to talk with your children in \nage-appropriate ways about demographics, the economy, social policy, our democratic system, \nand the rule of law. We will also talk about the world's response to yesterday's election results, our \nindividual responsibilities as citizens to continue to give voice to our beliefs, and appropriate \nchannels of political activism. On a more basic level, we will stress the importance of not being a \ngloating winner or a sore loser, and about the strength of our nation, its history of responding to \ndramatic political change, and the hopefulness of the future. \nAs for you, our families, I offer two resources. Last week at a NYSAIS heads-of-school conference \nthat I attended, the University of Pennsylvania educator Ali Michael spoke about advancing our \nnational dialogue about race. This morning Dr. Michael wrote a Huffington Post piece, \"What Do  \nWe Tell the Children?\", a moving yet direct reminder of how we, as adults, can model our \nresponses for the young people around us. Next Wednesday, November 16, from 6:3o to 8 \np.m., Semeka Smith-Williams and the PA Diversity Committee are holding a \"Post-\nElection Healing\" evening here at Packer. \nPlease reach out if you have questions, suggestions, or simply would like to share your thoughts, \nand take good care. \nBest regards. \nBruce L.

He's a special guy.\" \nBut when asked by reporters about Cinque in May, Trump denied knowing anything about him or his criminal \npast. \n\"If a guy's going to give you an award, you take it,\" the President-elect said at the time. \"You don't tend to look \nup his whole life story.\" \nThe Trump transition team did not immediately return a request for comment on how the President-elect knows \nCinque or why they appeared together Saturday. \nWhile standing alongside Cinque, Trump also took a moment to address the terror attack that left scores of \nnightclub revelers in Istanbul dead over the weekend — and how the bloodbath somehow necessitates a \nMexican border wall. \n\"We will build a wall, you know that. We will build a wall,\" the President-elect told the raucous crowd. \n\"And speaking of walls,\" he continued. \"In Turkey tonight — has anybody heard? Big disaster took place in \nTurkey tonight. Many, many, many people killed...It's a horror show. So we're going to get things running \nproperly.\" \nISIS claimed responsibility for the Saturday attack  , which left at least 39 people dead and dozens more \nwounded, calling the lone gunman who carried out the massacre a \"heroic soldier of the caliphate.\" The suspect  \nhad yet to be named and located by Turkish authorities early Tuesday. \nThe President-elect made building a wall along the country's southern border one of his main campaign talking \npoints, frequently promising his supporters that it will be a \"great\" and \"beautiful\" wall. \nBut his pledge to construct a border barrier has gone under several renditions, with the President-elect admitting \nin November that it might actually end up \"part wall, part fence.\"  \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 033211 \n\n\n\n2017-01-06 11:28:17\n\nFrom: Sultan Bin Sulayem \n\nTo: NA\n\nCC: NA\n\nSubject: Re: Presidential inauguration \n\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 032414\n\nFrom: Sultan Bin Sulayem \nSent: 1/6/2017 11:28:17 AM \nSubject: Re: Presidential inauguration \nImportance: High \nDo you think it will be possible to shake hand with trump \nSent from my iPhone \nvery many people going. it will be very crowded. but if you can meet some before or after in either wash or \nny, it might be worth it. . but unlikely \nOn Fri, Jan 6, 2017 at 4:08 AM, Sultan Bin Sulayem \nShould I accept the invitation sent by Tom barrack \nSent from my iPhone \nwrote: \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 032414 \n\n\n\n2017-01-06 11:29:46\n\nFrom: NA\n\nTo: Sultan Bin Sulayem \n\nCC: NA\n\nSubject: Re: Presidential inauguration \n\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 032950\n\nSent: 1/6/2017 11:29:46 AM \nTo: Sultan Bin Sulayem \nSubject: Re: Presidential inauguration \n1 561 655 7626 call to discuss if you are free \nOn Fri, Jan 6, 2017 at 6:28 AM, Sultan Bin Sulayem &lt;________________ \nDo you think it will be possible to shake hand with trump \nSent from my iPhone \n&gt; wrote: \nvery many people going. it will be very crowded. but if you can meet some before or after in either wash or \nny, it might be worth it. . but unlikely \nOn Fri, Jan 6, 2017 at 4:08 AM, Sultan Bin Sulayem ‹&gt; wrote: \nShould I accept the invitation sent by Tom barrack \nSent from my iPhone \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 032950 \n\n\n\n2017-01-06 14:49:57\n\nFrom: NA\n\nTo: Sultan Bin Sulayem \n\nCC: NA\n\nSubject: Re: Presidential inauguration \n\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 032952\n\nSent: 1/6/2017 2:49:57 PM \nTo: Sultan Bin Sulayem \nSubject: Re: Presidential inauguration \nhttp://www.cnn.com/2017/01/06/politics/tom-barrack-donald-trump-inauguration/index.html \nOn Fri, Jan 6, 2017 at 4:08 AM, Sultan Bin Sulayem &lt; &gt; wrote: \nShould I accept the invitation sent by Tom barrack \nSent from my iPhone \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 032952 \n\n\n\n2017-01-08 21:11:37\n\nFrom: Richard Merkin \n\nTo: Richard Merkin \n\nCC: NA\n\nSubject: RE: Re: \n\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 032416\n\nFrom: Richard Merkin \nSent: 1/8/2017 9:11:37 PM \nSubject: RE: Re: \nImportance: High \nWhere?

He revealed his dark side in a room backstage, where we smoked \na joint, and he told me how he used to read Nazi hate literature to get him in the mood to \nperform. And there was a certain sense of continuity on his deathbed. The night before he died, he said to a \nclose friend, James Drougas, \"Trump will be assassinated soon.\" \n\"Professor\" Corey also had a humanitarian streak. In 1996, in my magazine, The Realist, I published a photo of \nhim, from a video by his son Richard, presenting Fidel Castro a bag of California-grown pistachio nuts (Castro \nsaid, \"California, hmmmm, good climate there for nuts\"), a book on the Rosenberg controversy, and a credit-\ncard-size calculator (Castro said, \"I'll have to use my little pinky to push the buttons\"). Dave Channon reported \nthatCorey was on a diplomatic mission to lift the embargo on health supplies to Cuba, and he visited a hospital \nthat was providing sophisticated treatment for the survivors of Chernobyl.

A COMMERCIAL THAT THEY'RE LOSING BECAUSE OF KATHY: \nSQUATTY POTTY - KATHY GRIFFIN \"FULL OF SHIT\" (2017) \n(USA) \n09 May, 201/ By Dabitch 0 Comments \nSecond week of May this Kathy Griffin ad rolls out digital media only, where Kathy tells people that they are \"full of \nshit.\" Literally. See, Kathy Griffin has a potty mouth but also a selling point - the reason you'd use the squatty potty \nis to properly empty your bowels. \"It's like a colonic\" she explains, but without that hose up your ass. A cute blue \nturd bleeps her potty mouth but the point is still made. \nYou may remember Squatty Potty's pooping unicorn video created by the Harmon Brothers in 2015. Now Kathy \nGriffin is their first celebrity spokesperson. The brand's CEO and co-creator, Bobby Edwards, finds her quirky, brave \nand fearless, which makes her a good ambassador for the brand as they target women with this campaign. \nEdwards says the brand team fell in love with the \"full of shit\" idea from Bravery Films, \"it got the biggest laughs\" \nfrom staff. Howie Ronay, Bravery Films' founder and chief creative officer, a former FCB exec who worked on the \n2013 viral hit \"Ship My Pants\" for Kmart explains: \"We know a lot of people struggle with this issue, and we decided \nto take a common colloquial phrase and use it literally.\" Basically, this is \"ship my pants II.\" Enough about poop, not \nall ads can be great. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 033241 \n\n\n\n2017-06-13 01:25:21\n\nFrom: Kathy Ruemmler \n\nTo: NA\n\nCC: NA\n\nSubject: Re: \n\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 032549\n\nFrom: Kathy Ruemmler \nSent: 6/13/2017 1:25:21 AM \nSubject: Re: \nImportance: High \nMaybe Trump wants to get impeached.

If some share advantages of luck and otherse dont, the curve flattens, \nor becomes bimodal. one can imagine the fomation of \"lucky enclaves\" where luck is actually manufactured in \na sense, and effects kept inthe group and further amplified. In a way, it is a kind of \"market\" to capture unusual \nevents or to create cascades of events that would be otherwise difficult to create, anticipate, or predict?. I was at \nlunch yesterday with Dan Rose and he was saying that all of the major real estate families in NYC (excepting \nTrump) collectively think of the longer-term consequences of their actions for the larger group of dynasties. \nHow do these \"intentinal\" actions affect the natrual probability distributions? Perhaps not at all (!!!) but they \nmight shift the curve or displace others at different places in the aggregate population (the curve). Lets keeep \nthinking. \nBTW, this also has implication for my life (and yours)- we want to be members of various \"lucky groups\" \n(physical, mental, emotional, intellectual, etc), and if we pick the right sub-group, there will be natural \nregression to the mean in that group.... so, surround yourself with people as gifted or more, and use the power of \nRTM? Sometimes, it only works if the gaps are not too large, but I have found it a very useful heuristic in life.... \nin lots of areas. \nWhen are you back? \nsince luck is not zero sum. cant figure out how to move up the curve. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 032550 \n\n\n\n2017-07-10 07:29:37\n\nFrom: Thorbjon Jagland \n\nTo: NA\n\nCC: NA\n\nSubject: Re: \n\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 032551\n\nFrom: Thorbjon Jagland \nSent: 7/10/2017 7:29:37 AM \nSubject: Re: \nImportance: High \nIn Norway.

This was \nreaffirmed in a letter to the King. \nAfter @realDonaldTrump's Riyadh visit, he changed the US stance on the MBS v MBN power struggle and \nforced the establishment to back MBS. \nPast US administrations were keen on avoiding strife within GCC: This is because American interests cannot be \nupheld without a harmonic GCC. \nThat was until @realDonaldTrump's return from Saudi upon which Qatar siege began and he openly supported \nit contradicting Defence&State Dept \nThat was until @realDonaldTrump's return from Saudi upon which Qatar siege began and he openly supported \nit contradicting Defence&State Dept \nMore bizarrely; MBS has a secure direct line to Trump like no other leader has - not even Israeli Netanyahu & \nBritish May... \nThe following story explains MBS's 'special' influence over @realDonaldTrump - even if it means \ncompromising America's national interests... \nDuring @realDonaldTrump's Riyadh visit in May 2017 a private yacht discreetly arrived at Jeddah Port; heavily \nguarded and identity hidden. \nEven the Port's authorities were not allowed near it. Only a number of individuals reached it - delivering several \nboxes of cash ($1bn USD). \nAfter loading the boxes, the yacht disappeared. The operation lasted hours & was kept secret as was yacht's \nidentity, origin and destination \nIt transpired from MBS's inner circles that the $ lbn was from MBS himself & the yacht belonged indirectly to \n@Trump Organisation. #Trump MBS \nSent from my iPhone \nwowo \nOn Mon, Nov 6, 2017 at 2:39 PM, &lt; wrote: \nhttp s ://www. al-monitor. com/pulse/en/originals/2017/11/s audi-arab ia-crown-prince-remove-opp onents-\nnational-guard.html  \nSent from my iPhone \nthe missile or the anti corruption \nOn Sat, Nov 4, 2017 at 4:18 PM, wrote: \nkeep close eye on what is going on in saudi right now \nSent from my iPhone \nim really looking forward to it. . however today sick with flu \nOn Thu, Nov 2, 2017 at 10:48 AM, wrote: \ni m going to germany next week for two days to see terry. any plans to visit gcc soon? \nSent from my iPhone \ngood proposal. everyone there still dealing with remnants of investor conference. . hope your are well \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 032646 \n\n\n\n2017-11-16 21:52:54\n\nFrom: NA\n\nTo: Lesley Groff \n\nCC: NA\n\nSubject: Re: \n\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 033046\n\nSent: 11/16/2017 9:52:54 PM \nTo: Lesley Groff \nSubject: Re: \nImportance: High \n27 \nOn Thu, Nov 16, 2017 at 4:48 PM, Lesley Groff &lt;_____________________&gt; wrote: \nWe have a ticket for to go back to Paris on Nov 24.

Leonnig \nThe Justice Department is investigating whether longtime Republican fundraiser Elliott \nBroidy sought to sell his influence with the Trump administration by offering to deliver U.S. \ngovernment actions for foreign officials in exchange for tens of millions of dollars, \naccording to three people familiar with the probe. \nAs part of the investigation, prosecutors are scrutinizing a plan that Broidy allegedly \ndeveloped to try to persuade the Trump government to extradite a Chinese dissident back to \nhis home country, a move sought by Chinese President Xi Jinping, according to two of the \npeople. \nThey are also investigating claims that Broidy sought $75 million from a Malaysian business \nofficial if the Justice Department ended its investigation of a development fund run by the \nMalaysian government. The Malaysian probe has examined the role of the former prime \nminister in the embezzlement of billions of dollars from the fund. \nA Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment. Christopher Clark, an attorney \nfor Broidy, declined to comment. \nBroidy's alleged activities were detailed in news reports earlier this year that cited hacked \nemails. The Los Angeles-based venture capitalist, who served as top fundraiser for the \nRepublican Party and President Trump, has said  that allegations against him are an effort by \nhis enemies to smear him. \nRudolph W. Giuliani, an attorney for Trump, said he had no knowledge of any request for \nrecords related to Broidy. The White House referred a request for comment to the \nRepublican National Committee, which declined to comment. \n[Trump fundraiser Elliott Broidy sues Qatar alleging cyber smear campaign] \nIn recent weeks, prosecutors with the Justice Department's public integrity section___which \nexamines possible political and government corruption___have sought documents related to \nBroidy's business dealings. \nAmong the information sought by investigators are details about Broidy's work on behalf of \nand interactions with the Chinese and Malaysian officials, according to two people familiar \nwith the document requests. \nAs part of their efforts, prosecutors have subpoenaed casino magnate Steve Wynn, the \nformer RNC finance chairman and longtime Trump friend, for copies of records and \ncommunications related to Broidy. \nAn attorney for Wynn, Reid Weingarten, declined to comment, saying only that Wynn is \ncooperating with the Justice Department. \n\"Steve Wynn is completely cooperating with the investigation and he certainly has no reason \nto believe that anyone acted improperly in anything he knew about or was involved in,\" \nWeingarten said in a statement. \nWynn was tapped by Trump to serve as the RNC 's lead fundraiser after the election. Earlier \nthis year, he stepped down from that post and from his executive role at his resort company \nafter reports of sexual misconduct. Wynn has denied the allegations of inappropriate \nbehavior. \nThe public integrity probe is the latest legal challenge for Broidy, who helped corral big  \ndonors to support Trump's presidential campaign, throwing a lavish fundraiser for the then-\nnominee at his Los Angeles-area home during the 2016 campaign. After the election, he was \nappointed to serve as a national deputy chairman for the RNC. \nBroidy sought to parlay his party role and connections to the White House and on Capitol \nHill in pitches to foreign governments, according to a person with direct knowledge of his \nactivities. \nIn April, he resigned from his RNC position in the wake of a report that he had paid a former \nPlayboy model $1.6 million in exchange for her silence about a sexual affair. Trump's \npersonal attorney, Michael Cohen___another RNC fundraiser___helped arrange the \nsettlement, Broidy acknowledged. \n[RNC deputy finance chair steps down after admitting Trump's lawyer negotiated settlement \nbetween him and pregnant Playboy model] \nCohen is under investigation by federal prosecutors in Manhattan who are examining \nwhether he fraudulently obtained millions of dollars in loans and whether his efforts to \nsquash negative stories about Trump during the campaign violated election law. \nBroidy's business dealings captured the attention of investigators for special counsel Robert \nS. Mueller III, who asked at least one witness about Broidy's activities, according to a \nperson familiar with the matter. \nBroidy's attempts to solve high-level headaches for the Chinese and Malaysian governments \nwere first reported this spring by the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times, which \ncited in part a cache of hacked emails. \nBroidy has said the documents were stolen by enemies seeking to ruin his reputation. \n\"This whole narrative is a fabrication driven by hackers who want to undermine me,\" Broidy \nsaid in a statement to the Times. Earlier this year, he filed a lawsuit against the country of \nQatar, alleging that it hacked his email accounts in retaliation for his allegations that Qatar \nsupports terrorists. A spokesman for the Qatari government has called the suit \"without fact \nor merit. \n,1 \nThe Journal reported in March that, according to a draft contract, Broidy and his wife, Robin \nRosenzweig, were seeking $75 million from Malaysian businessman Jho Low if federal \nprosecutors dropped their investigation into a Malaysian state investment fund. \nThe Justice Department has filed civil suits claiming $4.5 billion in public money was \nmisappropriated from the fund, 1Malaysia Development Berhad, seeking to claim a portion \nof those assets. Last month, Malaysian authorities charged former prime minister Najib \nRazak with embezzling billions in public money from the fund. \nClark, the Broidy attorney, told The Journal that Rosenzweig's firm had been hired to \nprovide strategic advice to Low, adding that \"at no time did Mr. Broidy or Ms. Rosenzweig, \nor anyone acting on their behalf, discuss Mr. Low's case with President Trump, any member \nof his staff, or anyone at the U.S. Department of Justice.\" \nThe Times reported  in April that Broidy had explored ways to force Chinese exile Guo \nWengui to leave the United States. The billionaire businessman had fled China in 2014 as he \nwas facing arrest for a range of charges, including corruption. Guo has said the allegations \nwere fabricated by a government that wants to silence him. \nSince his arrival in the U.S., Guo has publicly detailed allegations of corruption in the \nChinese ruling party. \nThe Times reported that Broidy drafted a plan to enlist Emirati officials to pressure the U.S. \nto turn over Guo. In his statement to the newspaper, Broidy said he \"never had a strategy or \nplan regarding Mr. Guo nor was there any compensation given or even discussed.\" \nBroidy's alleged efforts to push for Guo's extradition came after Wynn separately helped \ndeliver a message from the Xi government seeking to have the dissident returned to China, \naccording to a person familiar with the effort. \nWynn, who has contacts with Chinese officials because of his business interests in Macau, \nhand-delivered a letter to Trump seeking Guo '5 deportation, The Journal reported  last year. \nA spokesman for Wynn Resorts has said that the report about Wynn's role was false. \nAt the time, the president expressed interest in assisting the Chinese, but was met with \nresistance by senior law enforcement officials, according to the person. \nWhite House officials did not respond to requests for comment. \nBrian M.

Facebook's miss in 2Q18—which drove a $120 billion single-day market cap \nloss, the biggest ever for a U.S. company—showed how decisive a turn could be if more \nU.S. tech darlings stumble this quarter. \nThere are mounting fundamental reasons to question the 3Q18 earnings \nprospects of FAANG, from the accelerating user backlash against Facebook to Apple's \ntrade war exposure to Amazon's rapidly-intensifying workforce revolt that could see the e-\ncommerce giant left with no option but to raise wages and improve workplace conditions \nfor its warehouse and Whole Foods employees. \nHowever, as Apabhai suggests, the message BAT is sending is less about earnings, and \nmore about the cost of exuberance. And FAANG exuberance faces threats that go beyond \nfundamentals. A flurry of regulatory announcements last week signaled the \npolitical tide has turned in the U.S. Across every branch of government, the \nmessage was consistent: the U.S. no longer trusts tech giants to self-\npolice. And the public agrees—according to a Gallup poll last month, 79% of \nAmericans now believe \"tech companies should be regulated the same way \nthe news media is.\" \nRegardless of political will, threats may not turn to action in the near term. Nonetheless, \nFAANG appears increasingly vulnerable to a decisive sentiment shift. At some point, the \nrelentless barrage of bad news will force investors to begin pricing in regulatory risks. Any \nsustained stumble by FAANG's leadership could cripple exuberance, and cause an \nunraveling of passive and algorithmic strategies that are heavily overweight tech \n(see W/LTWApril 7, 2018 for more). We will continue to watch closely to estimate \ntiming, but given SAT's collapse, today more than ever, acute scrutiny of tech \ngiant leadership is required. \nThrough August 28, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft had accounted for greater than 35% of \nthe S&P 500's total return this year, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices data. It took \nAmazon just 165 trading days to grow its market value from $600 billion in January to $1 \ntrillion. The combined market cap of FAAMG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and \nGoogle) now sits over $4 trillion, or roughly equal to the combined market cap of the 283 \nsmallest S&P 500 members. \nTech's continued market leadership means investors have largely discounted \nthe mounting risks tech giants face. We have been warning about the downsides of \ntech giant monopolism for more than two years in these pages, from surveillance/data \nsecurity concerns to anticompetitive behavior and their role in escalating inequality. For \nthe political establishment, for the media, for the public, this year has seen a \nbroad awakening—the Cambridge Analytica scandal, the backlash against Jeff Bezos' \nastonishing wealth, and tech's ever-skyrocketing market caps were all warning signs. The \npast month signals a new phase has begun: from a distant rumbling of change \nto preparation for action. \nThe number of significant tech-related regulatory developments that have emerged from \nthe U.S. and the E.U. in recent weeks is nothing short of staggering. Here is an \nabbreviated list: \n• President Trump attacked Google for liberal bias, and claimed Google, Facebook, \nand Amazon represent \"a very antitrust situation\". \n• Attorney General Jeff Sessions convened a meeting of Republican state \nattorneys general to discuss whether tech giants \"may be hurting competition and \nintentionally stifling the free exchange of ideas on their platforms.\" \n• Facebook, Twitter, and Google were called to testify in front of the House and Senate \nabout election interference, political bias, etc. Google declined to attend. \n• The FTC has begun a series of hearings on Digital Age antitrust, the first such \nhearings since the 1990s. \n• The FTC revealed the hiring of Lina Kahn—heralded for authoring a groundbreaking \nantitrust argument against Amazon—as an advisor. (See section 5 for more.) \n• Republican Senator Orrin Hatch asked the FTC to reopen a 2013 \nantitrust case against Google. \n• Democratic Senator Mark Warner released a six-point policy proposal on regulating \nthe tech industry. \n• Democratic Senator Bernie Sanders proposed the \"BEZOS Act\", which would tax \ncorporations one dollar for every dollar low-wage workers receive in government health-\ncare benefits or food stamps. \n• The E.U. Parliament voted 438 to 226 to back a draft proposal of \ncopyright reformsthat will impose unprecedented liability on information platforms. \n• France is pushing to have \"Right to be Forgotten\" laws applied globally, \nwhich Google is now fighting in court. \n• Reports emerged that the E.U. is considering investigating Google's location-\ntracking practices on data privacy grounds. \nWe will continue to watch each development in the U.S. and E.U. closely to understand if \nand when debate turns to action. For now, we agree with the analysis of NYU Stern \nprofessor Scott Galloway, who told CNBC last week after the congressional hearings: \nI don't see anything meaningful coming out of this panel, much less Washington...D.C. \nlacks the domain expertise or the will to go after big tech. Where you may \nsee it is, one, out of Brussels and, two, out of [the FTC, the DOJ, or] a red \nstate whose attorney general sees the brightest path between the AG's mansion and the \ngovernor's mansion is a populist argument against big tech. \nEvidence of fundamental weakness could exacerbate the investor reaction to escalating \nregulatory news.

As we note \nin section 1, smartphone handset sales in China in August were reported at \n32.6 million units, a decline of 20.9% year-over-year and 11.8% month-on-\nmonth. Moreover, no firm could suffer more if China decides to target tech \nsupply chains in retaliation to Trump's tariffs. \nYet, the risks extend beyond Asia. On Wednesday, Apple announced its \nnewest generation of iPhones. It is following the same strategy as last year, \nreleasing ever-more expensive phones as it tries to keep profit growth on \npace despite a largely-matured smartphone market. As The Wall Street \nJournal reported this week, projections suggest last year's $1,000 iPhone X \nunderperformed previous launches: \"Even for Apple and its devoted fans, \nthe art of the upsell appears to have some limits...Analysts believe the iPhone \nX has accounted for about 30% of iPhone unit sales in the recent nine-month \nperiod...That is below the share the company's newest models typically get in \na given cycle.\" Will a $1,200 iPhone cross the limits of what the market will \ntolerate? \nLandon Thomas, Jr. \nFinancial Reporter \nNew York Times \nhttp://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/t/landon jr thomas/index.  \nhtml  \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 033119 \n\n\n\n2018-09-19 14:56:08\n\nFrom: Jack LANG______________________ \n\nTo: NA\n\nCC: NA\n\nSubject: Re: \n\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 032811\n\nFrom: Jack LANG______________________ \nSent: 9/19/2018 2:56:08 PM \nSubject: Re: \nImportance: High \nDear Jeffrey, \nDear Jeffrey, \nHave you received my email about Serge Moati's film project? \nOur recent conversation on Trump was exciting. \nOnce again you are right. \nSee you soon, \nWith my friendship, \nJack \nJack- tom - tom jacques \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 032811 \n\n\n\n2018-09-20 10:01:48\n\nFrom: NA\n\nTo: Jack LANG \n\nCC: NA\n\nSubject: Re: \n\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 033121\n\nSent: 9/20/2018 10:01:48 AM \nTo: Jack LANG \nSubject: Re: \ni was offline for yom kippur . can you put me in direct contact.? happy holiday \nOn Wed, Sep 19, 2018 at 10:56 AM, Jack LANG &lt; &gt; wrote: \nDear Jeffrey, \nDear Jeffrey, \nHave you received my email about Serge Moati's film project? \nOur recent conversation on Trump was exciting. \nOnce again you are right. \nSee you soon, \nWith my friendship, \nJack \nJack- tom - tom jacques \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 033121 \n\n\n\n2018-09-20 17:43:37\n\nFrom: Lawrence Krauss \n\nTo: NA\n\nCC: NA\n\nSubject: Re: \n\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 032812\n\nFrom: Lawrence Krauss \nSent: 9/20/2018 5:43:37 PM \nSubject: Re: \nImportance: High \nKafka \nLawrence M.

My passion is the Italian Renaissance and the rich history behind it, especially the works of 15th century masters such \nas Masaccio and Bellini.

These all offered great ideas for the future of the world. \nFascism and Communism shared some common features: authoritarian, strong leaders and a belief that their revolutions had to \nbe carried through with violence. This led to the mass murders in the Nazi concentration camps and in the Soviet Gulags. \nIn the mid war periods, the \"Litfass columns\" that were originally designed to carry advertising, became the outdoor galleries \nfor the war of ideologies. The political poster was born. High quality posters from every political party in Germany popped up \non the columns. Hitler's propaganda chief G8ebels stated that the Nazi election campaign should be run through speeches and \nposters. The other parties responded in kind. An art form thus became an essential political tool in the battle for votes. The \npropagandist Art used by the Nazis and communists alike was essential in helping sell their message to the masses. \nIndeed, much of the art that was critical of these movements was suppressed or censored and \"subversive\" artists cowed, in \nsome cases imprisoned or even worse. \nThe liberal democratic model departed sharply from these authoritarian perspectives by presenting the alternative of free and \ntransparent elections, the rule of law and freedom of speech. In the mid-war period the three narratives were competing to be the \nconceptual frame for society. After the Second World War fascism was crushed leaving the two competing ideologies of \ncommunism and liberal democracy. After the demise of communism in 1989, through to the late 1990's, liberal democracy was \nvictorious in the idealogical battlefield. Some historians, like Francis Fukuyama, went so far as to proclaim this period as \"the \nend of history\". \nA key piece of art that championed this kind of ideology was Sheppard Fairey's campaign poster for Barack Obama. In this \nposter, Fairey, a well established graffiti artist uses urban colours and stencilling techniques combined with the message \n\"HOPE\" to promote the incoming presidents positive values and popularity with the young. It is notable that Fairey's most \nrecent political poster protests the Trump presidency rather than promote it. \nWith the rise of so called \"illiberal democracy\", with strong parties standing for populist ideologies, we have now moved into \nwhat can be described as the age of bewilderment. We were not in fact at the \"end of history\". Once again the future looks \nunpredictable and insecure and artists are responding in different ways. \nJeremy Deller, a British Turner prize winning artist created a work which features a car damaged in the bombing of the historic \nMutanabbi Street book market, which resulted in the deaths of 38 people. Here, an art work has been used to show the aftermath \nof an event. This event was the result of the Iraq war, which was seen as a way to spread democracy. Here Art is used as a \nmeans by which to explore the effects of ideology rather than promote it, another really interesting area in the study of the \nintersections between ideology and art. \nExploring how art reflects the historical and ideological contexts of the world around it is fascinating to me and I would love to \nstudy these ideas in more depth at undergraduate level. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 033415 \n\n\n\n2018-10-30 13:06:54\n\nFrom: Edward Rod Larsen \n\nTo: NA\n\nCC: NA\n\nSubject: Re: Essays \n\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 033417\n\nFrom: Edward Rod Larsen \nSent: 10/30/2018 1:06:54 PM \nSubject: Re: Essays \nImportance: High \nwill do \nessay 1. change next to the last sentence.

But her unflappable sense of humor was \nfully intact as she recounted to me how she found out the bad news and ended up revealing more than \never before about how the streaming service treated her over the past year. \nDuring our long conversation for the first-ever episode of my new podcast The Last Laugh, Silverman \nalso spoke frankly about what it has been like to see her friend Al Franken accused of alleged sexual  \nmisconduct and attempted to clarify the controversial comments she made to Howard Stern about  \nLouis C.K. She reflected on some of her most iconic roles and looked ahead to what comes next. \nHighlights from the interview are below and you can listen to the whole thing right now by subscribing \nto The Last Laugh on Apple Podcasts, the Himalaya app or wherever you listen to podcasts. \nOn the 'heartbreaking' cancelation of! Love You, America \n\"It came as a surprise. We were so sure we were getting picked up. We're all super bummed about it. I \nknow that they did love the show, but I think what it cost compared to its popularity or the eyes that \nthey had on it didn't___you know, the people that make the decisions there don't have any connection to \nthe show. And it is just so heartbreaking because I kind of feel cut off at the knees.\" \nSarah Silverman on 'The Last Laugh' \nCassandra Church/Starburns Audio \nOn the 'bullshit' allegations against Al Franken \n\"I can only just be honest and say, if I didn't know Al Franken, I'd probably be like yeah, go girl, me \ntoo, fuck that shit. Because I do know him, I don't feel that way. So maybe I'm too close to it and just \nseeing the dots not the big picture. But I just can't believe it. The U.S.O. thing is bullshit and if you \nwatch the sketch they did, give me a fucking break. He may be guilty of doing pedestrian comedy, I \nguess, but he apologized and she accepted his apology. But it does seem that the Republican Party \nand I don't think this is something to emulate at all___doesn't apologize, denies everything, admits \nnothing and everyone keeps their job. And I hate that that's what we teach our children. But if you \napologize and say, 'I want there to be an ethics investigation on me and I want to do everything by the \nbook, this is my truth but I'm open to [the fact] that these women felt this way, I want to make this \nright,' I don't know why that person then loses their job.\" \n• \nBURN IT DOWN \nSarah Silverman Throws Hulu Under the Bus: Pck It'  \nMatt Wilstein  \n• \nGIVING THANKS \nWhy Sarah Silverman Is 'Thankful' for Trump \nMatt Wilstein  \nOn looking like an 'asshole' after commenting on Louis C.K. \n\"My experience with Louis as a teenager perhaps informs his pathology a bit. But in no way is it \nanalogous to crimes, to assaults, he subsequently committed that mirror it, that come from it. I was just \nspeaking about my own experience. And the headline was, 'He jerked off in front of me and I didn't \ncare.' And that's so cold and insulting and awful to the women who were hurt by his actions. So if you \nclicked on it, they quoted me. But if you didn't, and nobody does, it just makes me look like an asshole. \nAnd me looking like an asshole is the least of it. It hurt people and there was stuff that I said that I \ndon't think I was articulating the spirit of what I meant.\" \n'The Last Laugh' host Matt Wilstein and Sarah Silverman \nCassandra Church/Starburns Audio \nOn performing stand-up about being single without sounding \n'hacky' \nRELATED IN ENTERTAINMENT \nSarah Silverman Throws Hulu Under the Bus: `F*ck It'  \nComedians Reveal Their Realest Selves on 'The Last Laugh'  \nSeth Meyers Proves Trump Is the Real 'Husband From Hell' \n\"It's such an '80s comedienne premise, but then it was also my truth so I was trying to reconcile with \nit. It's hard to not be meta about it, because just to say 'I'm single' on stage. There's something that \nfeels so inherently hacky about it that I feel like I have these guilt pangs and then it just becomes a \nwhole other bit. It's always weird to navigate. I've always been in relationships for big chunks of time \nand every time I come out I'm like a generation older and I don't know what my station is.\" \nNext week on The Last Laugh podcast: Arrested Development and Veep star Tony Hale. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031785 \n\n\n\n2019-04-05 11:06:20\n\nFrom: Multiple Senders [Multiple Senders] \n\nTo: NA\n\nCC: NA\n\nSubject: live:linkspirit -- 2019/04/05 \n\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 032211\n\nFrom: Multiple Senders [Multiple Senders] \nSent: 4/5/2019 11:06:20 AM \nSubject: live:linkspirit -- 2019/04/05 \n04/05/2019 10:06:20 AM \nwhich friday ? \n04/05/2019 10:06:32 AM \nbut you can ttravel to me without it ? \n04/05/2019 10:06:42 AM \nI need your help this week \n04/05/2019 12:43:15 PM \nhttps://join.skype.com/invite/j1r0g0Vxn3fl3 \n04/05/2019 12:43:29 PM \nplease skype meet her today and she might fly with you \n04/05/2019 02:34:59 PM \n10 minutes \nlive:linkspirit \n04/05/2019 03:17:35 PM \nMay we call you? \nlive:linkspirit \n04/05/2019 03:39:19 PM \nWe googled you \n04/05/2019 03:39:36 PM \ndo i look cute \n04/05/2019 03:40:01 PM \nnow should understand that i dont care about her photos \nlive:linkspirit \n04/05/2019 03:40:24 PM \nNice article about girls for trump \nlive:linkspirit \n04/05/2019 03:40:28 PM \n:) \nlive:linkspirit \n04/05/2019 03:56:55 PM \nShould I send her passport to Lesley? \n04/05/2019 03:57:08 PM \ni did \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 032211 \n\n\n\n2019-04-13 22:40:00\n\nFrom: \n\nTo: Martin G Weinberg \n\nCC: NA\n\nSubject: Fwd: Off the record trump \n\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 033453\n\nFrom: \nSent: 4/13/2019 10:40:00 PM \nTo: Martin G Weinberg \nSubject: Fwd: Off the record trump \nImportance: High \nSent from my iPhone \nBegin forwarded message: \nFrom: \nDate: April 13, 2019 at 6:39:25 PM EDT \nTo:\" ' &lt; \nSubject: Re: Off the record trump \nThanks.

Grossman \nREMEMBERING CAVALIER MAGAZINE \n; Mrisman02 \nLAUNCHING A MAGAZINE \nMy friend Michael Simmons, who has been the editor of National Lampoon and High \nTimes, observes that cavalier hired fine scribes. A few examples: Thomas Pynchon, Philip Roth, \nWilliam Saroyman, Isaac Asimov, Theodore Sturgeon. Cavalier was launched by Fawcett \nPublications in 1952. \nMen's magazine Cavalier (motto: \"For the American Male\") was published the year \nbefore Playboy to whom it has often been compared, and back in the day tried to be seen as \nslightly hipper, more youthful and considered a bit more clever than its big name rival. Almost \nan anti-establishment Playboy. A slogan stated: \"Your dad bought Playboy, you \nbought Cavalier.\" \nI BECAME A COLUMNIST \nI was invited to write a column, named \"The Naked Emperor,\" for Cavalier, that was beginning \nto publish underground writers and artists. They paid me $1,000 a month. My first column was a \nreport on an auction of two-inch squares from the hotel bedsheets slept on by the Beatles during \ntheir first trip to America. \nThere were 300 screaming young girls, off on a fetishist's holiday. Obviously, there wouldn't be \nenough items to go around, but it was announced that the Beatles' unwashed towels and bed \nlinens were to be cut into two-inch squares and sold for $1 each. The price included a notarized \nstatement of authenticity. \nMy second column was about Lenny Bruce___titled \"Lenny the Lawyer,\" since he defended \nhimself in trials He was arrested for obscene performances only because there were no blasphemy \nlaws. I went to the bank and deposited my check, withdrawing half of it in cash, a $500 bill. \nLenny was alone in his hotel room on Christmas Day when I presented it to him. And, with a \nlarge safety pin, Lenny attached the $500 bill to the outside breast pocket of his denim dungaree \nj acket. \nAFTER JFK ASSASSINATION \nIn another column of mine, \"Jack Ruby and His Dirty Little Secret,\" it began, \"Lenny Bruce \ntold me how all the night club comics used to Jack Ruby's \"tattoo of a lady's schmutzik (translate: \npussy) in his armpit.\" If it wasn't a fact, I was quite willing to settle for an apocryphal allusion \nwhich nevertheless crystallized the entire personality of that alleged murderer who wanted so \nvery much to be liked. \nI say alleged because upon Ruby's own death. Dallas District Attorney Henry Wade said he \nwould dismiss the murder charge against him, a promise which has since been kept, although no \nsuch posthumous grace was ever officially bestowed on Lee Harvey Oswald. See, they grant you \nretroactive innocence only in the face of innumerable witnesses who were present at the actual \nevent through the miracle of inadvertent televised coverage. \nNow Jack Ruby's dirty little secret has been forever sealed away in his armpit by the hymen of \nhistory. Oh yeah, and at Lenny's funeral, that safety pin was still attached on his jacket. \nJULES SIEGEL \nTwo years before Lenny's death, with his permission I published his obituary in my own \nmagazine, The Realist. Before the issue went to press, he called his mother and a few others to \nlet them know it would only be a hoax. The point was that he couldn't get work and his work was \nhis life so he might as well be dead. And if people regretted that they hadn't helped him, well, \nnow they could have a second chance because he was still alive. The obituary evoked inquiries \nfrom newspapers, wire services, foreign publications, radio and TV. \n\"What's the meaning of it?\" one editor asked me. \"There's a lot of excitement at the city \ndesk.\" \n\"That is the meaning of it.\" \nA few years later, without my permission, Jules Siegel, the editor of a short-lived \nmagazine, Cheetah, published a fake obituary of me. I thought it was funny. An Associated Press \nreporter called, and I explained that it was a hoax. \n\"Are you sure?\" he asked. \n\"Of course. I would tell you if I was dead.\" \nSiegel started writing for cavalier. His first assignment was a profile of Sterling Hayden, an actor \nbest known in Dr, Stranglove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb. \nJournalist Adam Ellsworth described Siegel's \"Goodbye Surfing, Hello God\" with his most \nfamous example of rock journalism, but his most revolutionary was his article, \"The Big Beat.\" \nIt appeared in the Playboy-esque Cavalier magazine in 1965 and was one of the earliest writings \nhe'd ever seen on the development of rock and roll, from slaves singing in chains on their way to \nAmerica to Bob Dylan \"going electric\" at the Newport Folk Festival. \nThen Jules' friend, Arthur Kretchmer, became Cavalier's managing editor. \"When the editorial \ndirector later resigned,\" Kretchmer said, \"there was a 24-hour hiatus before the new editor \narrived.\" Siegel and Kretchmer had been discussing the possibility of publishing an issue on rock \nand roll, so to make it happen, Kretchmer went into the office at night and retyped the magazine's \nschedule to include their ideas. \nWhen the new editorial started, Kretchmer handed him the schedules and said, \"Here's what \nwe're working on.\" The new editorial director suspected nothing and the rock and roll issue went \nahead. Once the laughter died down, Jules talked for a good 25 minutes about \nsome of the ups and downs of his writing career and how hard it is to make a \nliving as any kind of a writer, let alone a \"rock journalist.\" and the people who \ncreated it, seriously. \nNow everybody writes about rock and roll that way. Jules was one of the \npeople who did it first. \"Goodbye Surfing, Hello God!\" is Jules's most famous \nexample of rock journalism, but I think his most revolutionary is his article \n\"The Big Beat.\" It appeared in the Playboy-esque Cavalier magazine in 1965 \nand is one of the earliest writings I've ever seen on the development of rock \nand roll, from slaves singing in chains on their way to America to Bob Dylan \n\"going electric\" at the Newport Folk Festival. \nJules Siegel died of a heart attack on November 17, 2012 at the age of 77. \nHe was a brilliant author, but neither Rolling Stone nor the New York \nTimes honored him with an obituary. Not even a fake one. \nCOMIC STRIPS \nArt Spiegelman tells me his work at Cavalier 50 years ago: \nI was first invited into the mag to do two full-color comix pages in 1969 (when being printed in color \nwas a Very Big Deal for me as was Getting Paid more than 25 bucks for a drawing), somehow in \nproximity to a big article on underground comix. It was around the time Vaughn Bode was made a \nregular contributor to the magazine, They were running some Crumb \"Fritz the Cat\" pages. All thanx \nto their hip, laid back and kind editor, Alan LeMond. \nI also did some gag cartoons, short strips and occasional illustrations for Cavalier (one especially \nbad drawing for a story by Bruce Jay Friedman, I recall). My work in 1969, as an apprentice \nunderground cartoonist taking too many drugs was really, really awful so I'm grateful for the editor's \nhip and laid-back kindness. But, hey, I was proud to be in a mag that published pieces by Pynchon, \nManny Farber and you. \nBy the time I'd gotten incrementally better as a cartoonist in the first half of the 1970s I was regularly \ndoing illustrations for soft-core fiction stories in Cavalier's low-rent sister \nmags, Dude, Gent and Nugget (even wrote a story or two there and got several of my San Francisco \ncomix cronies (Spain Rodriguez, Bill Griffith and Justin Greene) illustration gigs with Alan for those \nmags as well. \nI was first invited into the mag to do two full-color comix pages in 1969 (when being printed in color \nwas a Very Big Deal for me as was Getting Paid more than 25 bucks for a drawing), somehow in \nproximity to a big article on underground comix.

It depicts Spiegelman interviewing his father about his experiences \nas a Polish Jew and Holocaust survivor. The work employs postmodemist techniques and \nrepresents Jews as mice, Germans as cats, and Poles as pigs. In 1992, Maus won a Pulitzer Prize.] \nCOMIING AND GOING \nI wrote some movie reviews for Cavalier. I recall that Midnight Cowboy was 50 years ago. I \nalways went to two screenings. The first one I would go stoned with magic mushrooms. The \nsecond one I took notes. However, I got fired by Cavalier. \nThey declined to publish a particular column--my review of MASH as though it were a Busby \nBerkeley musical called Gook Killers of 1970-- ostensibly on the grounds of bad taste, but I \nlearned that three wholesalers had told the publisher they were pressured by the FBI and would \nrefuse to distribute Cavalier if my name appeared in it. \nOn top of that, my name was on a list of sixty-five \"radical\" campus speakers, released by the \nHouse Internal Security Committee. The blacklist was published in the New York Times, and \npicked up by newspapers across the country. It might have been a coincidence, but my campus-\nspeaking engagement-bookings stopped abruptly. It felt just like a film. \nOH, WELL \nIt was over for me, but it had been fun___like the issue with only the one large red headline \non the Cavalier cover: \"BEAT 'EM SENSELESS FIRST\"___THE FREE SPEECH \nCONTROVERSY, BY PAUL KRASSNER . . . \"Ironically,\" I wrote, \"it is this concept of the \ntotal education experience on campus which I believe to be the basic significance of the much-\nmisunderstood free-speech imbroglio at the University of California in Berkeley.\" \nThe sit-in lasted till 3 a.m. Next day, October 1, 1964, ten tables were manned again, and \na campus policeman approached one of the tables (manned by the Congress of Racial Equality) \nwhere a dozen persons were seated. One was singled out and placed under arrest. But before you \ncould say nonviolent demonstration, the police car was surrounded, its captors reaching as many \nas 3,000 students. During the late evening, bored fraternity men gathered and tossed lighted \ncigarettes and eggs on those sitting in the plaza. The demonstrators responded with silence. \nNext day, 450 police assembled on campus to remove the cop car and its arrested inhabitant, \nbut an agreement to negotiate was reached and the demonstrators dispersed. One of the folk songs \nto come out of the Free Speech Movement incidentally, was If I Negotiate With You, to the tune \nof the Beatles' If IFell in Love With You. \nOver the next couple of months there was a series of sit-ins and attempted negotiations, and \nthen, on December 2, the infamous Sproul Hall sit-in. It took twelve hours for 800 students to be \narrested by some 600 instructors of a new course called Introductory Police Brutality. These were \nfrom the lab notes student took. \nThere was a freshman co-ed at Berkeley who___long after she had forgotten what some \nprofessor spouted during an official lecture about Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment___would \nremember, with perhaps a twinge of frightened pride, learning from a fellow demonstrator that if \nshe planned to go limp when the police arrested her, it would be an act of practical feminine \nforesight to remove the earrings from her pierced lobes in advance. \nSo, now in 2019, fighting over free speech has been happening heavily at Berkeley campus again. \nMeanwhile, Trump grabbed a pussy on the Statue of Liberty. Cavalier, anyone? \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031979 \n\n\n\n2019-05-19 10:21:24\n\nFrom: Richard Kahn \n\nTo: NA\n\nCC: NA\n\nSubject: \"SNL\": Baldwin's Trump, De Niro's Mueller season 44 finale cold open - Axios \n\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 033358\n\nFrom: Richard Kahn \nSent: 5/19/2019 10:21:24 AM \nSubject: \"SNL\": Baldwin's Trump, De Niro's Mueller season 44 finale cold open - Axios \nImportance: High \nhttps://www.axios.com/snl-alec-baldwin-trump-dont-stop-me-now-60e0839e-68f5-4ce5-af36-8635dfcb694c.html \nRichard Kahn \nHBRK Associates Inc. \n575 Lexington Avenue, 4th Floor \nNew York, NY 10022 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 033358 \n\n\n\n2019-05-19 22:39:32\n\nFrom: NA\n\nTo: Weingarten, Reid \n\nCC: NA\n\nSubject: NA\n\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 033145\n\nSent: 5/19/2019 10:39:32 PM \nTo: Weingarten, Reid \nhttps ://www.blo omb erg. com/news/articles/20 19-05 - 1 9/the-world-agre es-with-trump-on-one-thing-when-it-\ncomes-to-iran  \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 033145 \n\n\n\n2019-05-20 21:26:52\n\nFrom: NA\n\nTo: Kathy Ruemmler \n\nCC: NA\n\nSubject: NA\n\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 033146\n\nSent: 5/20/2019 9:26:52 PM \nTo: Kathy Ruemmler \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/20 1 9/05/20/us/politics/trump-hunter-biden-\nchina.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 033146 \n\n\n\n2019-05-22 17:02:24\n\nFrom: Richard Kahn_______________________________ \n\nTo: NA\n\nCC: NA\n\nSubject: Trump shoots back at Democrats, declares 'I don't do cover-ups' \n\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 033359\n\nFrom: Richard Kahn_______________________________ \nSent: 5/22/2019 5:02:24 PM \nSubject: Trump shoots back at Democrats, declares 'I don't do cover-ups' \nImportance: High \nhttps://www.cnbc.com/video/2019/05/22/i-dont-do-cover-ups-president-trump-during-rose-garden-press-\nconference.html  \nhttps://nypost.com/2019/05/22/trump-shoots-back-at-democrats-declares-i-dont-do-cover-\nups/?utm source=maropost&utm medium=email&utm campaign=news alert&utm content=20190522&tpcc= \nnypbreaking&mpweb=755 -7962477-719004712  \nRichard Kahn \nHBRK Associates Inc. \n575 Lexington Avenue, 4th Floor \nNew York, NY 10022 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 033359 \n\n\n\n2019-05-28 15:18:36\n\nFrom: Richard Kahn________________________________ \n\nTo: NA\n\nCC: NA\n\nSubject: Mueller drew up obstruction indictment against Trump, Michael Wolff book claims \n\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031786\n\nFrom: Richard Kahn________________________________ \nSent: 5/28/2019 3:18:36 PM \nSubject: Mueller drew up obstruction indictment against Trump, Michael Wolff book claims \nImportance: High \nhttp s ://www.the guardian. com/us-news/2019/may/28/mueller-trump-ob struction-charge-michael-wo lff-b o ok-\nsiege-under-fire-news  \nRichard Kahn \nHBRK Associates Inc. \n575 Lexington Avenue 4th Floor \nNew York, NY 10022 \ntel \nfax \ncell \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031786 \n\n\n\n2019-05-28 20:51:55\n\nFrom: \n\nTo: NA\n\nCC: Stephen Rubin_________________________________ \n\nSubject: Michael Wolff Launch Party \n\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 033360\n\nFrom: \nSent: 5/28/2019 8:51:55 PM \nCC: Stephen Rubin_________________________________ \nSubject: Michael Wolff Launch Party \nAssistant Editor \nHenry Holt \n175 5th Ave. \nNew York, NY loom \nStephen Rubin \ninvites you to celebrate \nMICHAEL WOLFF \nupon the publication of \nSIEGE \nTrump Under Fire \nRSVP: \nJune 3, 6-8PM \n15 West 67th Street \n**Due to space, we cannot allow plus ones. \n**This may be a duplicate invitation because we were worried the \noriginal invitation went to your spam folder! \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 033360 \n\n\n\n2019-05-29 14:14:44\n\nFrom: Nicholas Ribis \n\nTo: NA\n\nCC: NA\n\nSubject: NA\n\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 032011\n\nFrom: Nicholas Ribis \nSent: 5/29/2019 2:14:44 PM \nMueller statement at 11am will be interesting - I think it's because of Michael wolff's new book and the \nreference to a draft indictment- it probably will be helpful to arr - talk after \nsent from my iPhone \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 032011 \n\n\n\n2019-05-29 16:57:42\n\nFrom: Roy Black \n\nTo: \n\nCC: NA\n\nSubject: FW: epstein \n\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 033361\n\nFrom: Roy Black \nSent: 5/29/2019 4:57:42 PM \n; Darren Indyke___________________________________ \nSubject: FW: epstein \nAttachments: image001.jpg; image002.jpg; image003.jpg \nfyi \nFrom: Roy Black \nSent: Wednesday, May 29, 2019 12:57 PM \nTo: \nSubject: epstein \nDear : we have no comment on the trump story.

Huberty, CFA — Morgan Stanley \nMay 29, 2019 10:28 PM GMT \nGiven the risk of further restrictive trade measures, we answer investors' top questions. We expect \nshares to remain choppy, with a near-term floor around $160. Our estimates are unchanged but \npeer multiple contraction drives our SoTP-driven PT to $231 (from $240). \nWhat is the latest view on iPhone demand in China? On Apple's April 30th earnings call, CEO Tim \nCook noted that the November-December period was likely to be the trough in iPhone demand in \nChina, following an improvement in performance during the March quarter helped by iPhone price \ncuts, VAT tax rollbacks, increased financing options and better consumer confidence. Data from \npush-messaging service provider Jigaung shows that the improvement in iPhone demand likely \npersisted through April, where Apple gained over 175bps of Chinese smartphone installed base \nshare Y/Y (1). However, the increasingly tough trade rhetoric and actions recently taken by US and \nChinese authorities make it less likely this trend will continue into May/June. Late last week, \nfollowing the Huawei blacklist, President Trump commented that \"it's possible that Huawei would be \n________included in a trade deal\", suggesting recent actions could be bargaining chips to use in trade \nnegotiations that can be worked out by/around the G20 Summit in late June, but with Apple guiding \nJune quarter revenue down 8% Q/Q (vs. trailing 3 year seasonality of -14% Q/Q), the risk remains \nthat weaker near-term demand in China increases the risk of a revenue shortfall. For reference, we \nmodel 37M iPhone shipments in the June quarter (-10% Y/Y), in-line with iPhone builds, which \nimplies a 5th consecutive quarter of double digit iPhone shipment declines in China. If we assume \nChinese demand significantly weakens in the last 6 weeks of the quarter and iPhone shipments \ninstead fall 50% Y/Y (a 10 point further deceleration from March Q declines), then we'd expect 2.3M \nlower iPhone units (-6% vs. our current model), $1.6B lower revenue (-2.9%) and a $0.05 hit to EPS \n(-2 \nThis alert is sent from: \nAndrew Atlas, Andrew.Atlas@morganstanley.com \nYou received this because you requested that you receive content and reports from: \nAPPLE INC. \nPlease contact your FA if you want to unsubscribe from the alerts. \nDisclosures: \nPlease see the full report for risks, disclosures and other important information. \nImportant disclosures regarding the relationship between the companies that are referenced in Morgan Stanley research \nand Morgan Stanley Wealth Management research are available on the Morgan Stanley Wealth Management disclosure \nwebs ite at https://www.morganstanley.com/online/researchdisclosures. \nMorgan Stanley Wealth Management Not Acting as Municipal Advisor \nMorgan Stanley Wealth Management is not acting as a municipal advisor to any municipal entity or obligated person \nwithin the meaning of Section 15B of the Securities Exchange Act (the \"Municipal Advisor Rule\") and the opinions or \nviews contained herein are not intended to be, and do not constitute, advice within the meaning of the Municipal Advisor \nRule. \nCopyright \nThe copyright in materials provided by Morgan Stanley is owned by Morgan Stanley & Co.

By 1968, more than a thousand deserters and draft resisters had escaped to Sweden.                                                                                                                           Many of them formed a group named the American Deserters Committee.  That ADC might just as well have served it as insane inadvertently satire. For example, a few friends kept a woman in her in her apartment, playing Beethoven in an attempt to reprogram her brain. An individual insisted that the Beatles were created as an instrument of psychological warfare. And the author himself became to believe the genocidal ambitions of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth’s secret plot to start World War III. And now, for whatever purpose, Donald Trump has met the same Majesty Queen Elizabeth.                                           Back In January 1974, journalists and activists whistle-blowers revealed the truth that there was a takeover by the CIA of the United States. Indeed, Lyndon LaRouche, the leader of a growing cult, spoke as his longtime alias, Lyn Marcus, to the audience in a New York shabby ballroom. He began describing the second phase of a psy-war game designed by the CIA, conducted on four continents, turning some of their most trusted colleagues into killers, drugged and imprisoned, reconditioned their minds, erased their memories of the experience, and returned to their friends as unknowing vehicles of a murderous conspiracy.      The American CIA was then to be performed at a secret facility near Stockholm, where Marcus explained how brainwashed candidates were hypnotized, subjected to electric shocks, forced to eat their own excrement, endure sexual humiliation, and tortured until they whined like puppies. Once they had been reduced to mental pulp, the programming began.      A literal kind of programming, following the rules of the computer age. Numbers linked to functions. Infinite loops of coded instructions, drilled into the subject by repetition, violence, the application of electrodes to bare skin. Finally, cyanide pills had been secreted inside their bodies, in order to eliminate the killers once they had fulfilled their programs.       No wonder Sweet admitted, “If I were to die without finishing this book, then someone out there would undoubtedly set up a Web page claiming that I’d been bumped off, by either the CIA, the Swedish secret services, or the bizarre political group that had once counted many of my interviewees as its members—and would, by the time my research was concluded, come to regard me as an enemy infiltrator. And that was then I knew I’d been swallowed by my own story. Swallowed, but not brainwashed.” He’s still alive.      Back in New York, at the National Caucus of Labor Committees, Marcus was the leader of Students for a Democratic Society. For better or worse, he was delivering a charismatic economics lecture to an enthusiastic SDS crowd. In 1968 that summer, they protested the Vietnam War at the National Democratic Convention in Chicago. The Yippies nominated a pig as a presidential candidate, and I started a rumor that we planned to drop LSD into the reservoir. And yes, Lyndon LaRouche decided to drop his alias into pure manure.      He was an unlovable conspiracy theorist who ran for the U.S. presidency eight times. He played himself as a cartoon character in an episode of The Simpsons in which aliens kidnapped presidential candidates Bill Clinton and Bob Dole, Immersing them in tanks of bubbling pink liquid. Homer shouted, “Oh my God! Lyndon LaRouche was right!” And Saturday Night Live featured “Lyndon LaRouche Theater,” in which Randy Quaid played LaRouche, with a bald wig, bow-tie and spectacles, narrating melodramatic twists, conspiracies, and confessing “I am insane.” *    *    *      Not mentioned in the book, near the end of March 1981, I delivered a keynote address at the Youth International Party convention in New York. These were the latterday Yippies, originally launched as the anti-Yippie “Zippies” during the 1972 both conventions in Miami. I asked the audience a rhetorical question, “How would you like to be a Secret Service agent guarding Ronald Reagan, knowing that his vice president, George Bush, is the former head of the CIA?”      Once again, satire would be outdistanced by reality. On March 30, the president was shot by John Hinckley in order to make a favorable impression on actress Jodie Foster so that he could take her bowling on a date. Ironicallly, Hinckley came out for gun control, and Reagan came out against it. I was scheduled to perform stand-up at Budd Friedman's Improvisation comedy club in Hollywood in April. He asked me to try and get some advance publicity. On April 2, the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner quoted a dispatch from the New Solidarity International Press Service:     A group of terrorists and drug traffickers linked to Playboy magazine met in New York City's Greenwich Village area and publicly discussed an assassination of President Ronald Reagan and Vice-President George Bush. The meeting convened by the Yippie organization, featured former Playboy editor Paul Krassner and numerous individuals associated with High Times magazine, Hustler magazine and the Chicago Sun-Times.      In a statement this afternoon, national Democratic Policy Committee advisory board chairman Lyndon LaRouche urged that this information be made public at this time as a means of assisting government investigators pursuing the assassination attempt against President Reagan. Playboy magazine, as an international dossier released in the March 30, 1981, issue of New Solidarity indicates, is at the center of an international apparatus that has in the past been directly implicated in high-level political assassinations.  Playboy’s response: “Absolute, unequivocal nonsense.” And Budd Friedman said, “Paul, that's not exactly what I meant by advance publicity.” My show went fine, but in July, New Solidarity escalated the attack and published a whole dossier on me: In the early 1950s, Paul Krassner was recruited to the stable of pornographers and “social satirists” created and directed by the British Intelligence’s chief brainwashing facility, the Tavistock Institute, to deride and destroy laws and institutions of morality and human decency. Among Krassner's circle of Tavistock iconoclasts, peddling smut in the name of humor and “creative expression,” were Lenny Bruce…  These people were taken seriously in certain quarters. LaRouche received enough campaign contributions to qualify him for matching funds from the government. And the U.S. Labor Party’s newsletter, Investigating Leads, was subscribed to by police departments across the country. In fact, when two thousand demonstrators protested the construction of the Seabrook nuclear power plant in New Hampshire, LaRouche's private intelligence network briefed a state police lieutenant that the demonstration would be “nothing but a cover for terrorist activity”--the exact same phrase the governor would use to the media a few days before the rally. Incidentally, I was never in England. Moreover, Tavistock…Tavistock…I just couldn't seem to remember anything about ever having been brainwashed at the Tavistock Institute. They must've deprogrammed it right out of my consciousness. *    *    * Although LaRouche and I both taught at the Free University of New York in 1966, we didn’t cross paths. One student said that “LaRouche presented the most credible, most articulate, and best-argued version of Marxist economics that I ever heard.” My class was titled, “Journalism and Satire and How to Tell the Difference.” My countercultural friend Ed Sanders—leader of the Fugs band and publisher of Fuck You/A Magazine of the Arts—taught “Revolutionary Egyptology.” In 1967, he orchestrated the levitation of the Pentagon.  LaRouche and his followers spent the year 2016 snickering behind their hands at the Republican candidate for the U.S. presidency. The organization even recorded a satirical song suggesting that the candidate’s core constituents were mentally ill. The singer trilled: “He’s a festering pustule on Satan’s rump! Don’t you be a chump for Trump!”       But when Hillary conceded defeat, the tune changed. Suddenly, Trump was not, as had been previously thought, a maniac poised to legalize heroin and govern on behalf of Wall Street, but America’s best chance to defeat the British Empire and forge a new alliance with Russia. It has been said that LaRouche’s wife, Helga, “keeps him on a tight leash.” She is a German political activist, and founder of the LaRouche movement's Schiller Institute, an international political and economic think tank, one of the primary organizations, with headquarters in Germany and the United States, and supporters in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Russia, and South America, among others.       Helga outlines the great potential for the world if a Russia, China and U.S. partnership develops to fight terrorism and develop the world economy. Trump’s successful meetings with China's president Xi Jinping and Russian President Putin is promising. However, that relationship will only improve if the American people step up to the challenge to ignore the British media campaign attempting to subvert his presidency, and fight to implement LaRouche's Four Law economic development program.      Helga believes that only with the support of the population will Trump be able to fulfill his campaign promises to the American people to restore Glass-Steagall and rebuild the country. The Glass-Steagall Act was signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933 as the Banking Act, which prohibited commercial banks from participating in the investment banking business. Helga makes an appeal from abroad to the American people not to miss this great historic opportunity. Dictator Trump has evolved from FDR’s fireside chat to morning tweets. Feckless cunt, anyone?

According to prosecutors, Avenatti pressed Nike to pay him millions of dollars as an \"internal investigator\" in addition to the much smaller figure he demanded from the sports gear giant for his youth basketball coach client.  The lack of nexus between his client's alleged injury at Nike's hands and Avenatti's demand for eight-figure fees as an investigator puts the allegations well beyond the realm of aggressive posturing and into the parameters of federal extortion statutes, said criminal defense attorney Jeremy Saland of Crotty Saland PC.  \"Being a blowhard is not illegal, but whether what he's claiming Nike did is fact or fiction doesn't justify trying to enrich himself with a job that doesn't help remedy a wrong suffered by a client,\" Saland said.  On Monday, federal officials in New York arrested Avenatti, charging the pugnacious Los Angeles lawyer with threatening Nike with a stock-price-sinking press conference about recruitment misconduct if it didn't pay up.  Avenatti, who purported to be representing the coach of a youth basketball team once sponsored by Nike, demanded $1.5 million for the client, who had recently seen Nike drop its support, according to the charges. Separately, Avenatti and another attorney — an unnamed co-conspirator since identified as celebrity defense attorney Mark Geragos — also demanded Nike hire them to conduct an \"internal investigation\" related to amateur player recruiting.  The cost: at least $12 million and as much as $25 million. Prosecutors said Avenatti was also recorded at a March 21 meeting with Nike lawyers at Boies Schiller Flexner LLP offering to end the entire matter, with no bad publicity for Nike, for $22.5 million.  If the company didn't agree, Avenatti threatened an immediate press conference amid the NCAA basketball tournament about Nike making payments to youth players and their families, prosecutors said, an event he promised would snowball into more bad press and people coming forward with claims of recruiting malfeasance.  In a recorded phone call, Avenatti told Nike attorneys that if the company tried to negotiate a cap on the investigation fees, he would go public and \"take a billion dollars off your client's market cap,\" according to the complaint. At a March 21 meeting in New York, Avenatti allegedly continued to wield threats and press for the investigator role, at one point asking Nike attorneys if they'd ever had \"the balls of a client in [their] hands.\"  \"Michael Avenatti may be the best lawyer in the world, according to Michael Avenatti, but there are appropriate courses of conduct to address an alleged wrongdoing, and I don't see how a demand of, 'Give me a job and pay me $12 million,' is ever going to make the client whole,\" Saland said.  Adam Felsenstein, a white collar defense specialist at Gallet Dreyer & Berkey LLP, called the prosecutor's narrative \"very extortive,\" particularly on the allegation regarding Avenatti's demand to be hired directly by the company. If that element of the charges is well-founded, it would effectively leave Avenatti without a \"cloak of legitimacy\" that he was acting solely to resolve a dispute on behalf of his client.  The complaint \"doesn't even refer to anticipated litigation. It's just, 'I'm going to reveal embarrassing information unless you pay me.' And once you start asking for money for yourself like that, you trend into extortion,\" Felsenstein said.  Barry Temkin of Mound Cotton Wollan & Greengrass LLP similarly characterized the alleged scheme as \"brazen,\" and voiced doubt Avenatti would be able to argue that he could pressure Nike to hire him as an investigator and stay within the legal lines.  \"He's going to them with a demand that they hire him even as he's threatening them with this press conference, which is screwed up on a lot of levels,\" he said. \"It's ambulance chasing, which is unethical. It's a conflict of interest, and who would want to hire someone to do an internal investigation who is also shaking them down?\"  Avenatti was arrested Monday just after he announced via Twitter an impending press conference about a \"major high school/college basketball scandal\" and criminal conduct \"at the highest levels of Nike.\"  In an unrelated action, federal officials in California charged Avenatti on Monday with defrauding a client out of a $1.6 million settlement and lying to a Mississippi bank to secure loans for his firm and a coffee business.  Avenatti was released in New York later in the day after posting a $300,000 bond. He is due in court on the California case on Monday. He did not respond to multiple requests for comment Tuesday. A message seeking comment from Geragos was also not returned.  Avenatti shot to national prominence last year representing Stormy Daniels, the porn actress who took $130,000 from Trump lawyer Michael Cohen to stay quiet about her affair with the future president and then sued to void the deal.  The brash lawyer seemed to relish needling Trump and others on countless cable news appearances and on Twitter. He also faced mounting legal troubles in the form of a $10 million judgment stemming from the breakup of his old firm, Eagan Avenatti LLP, and accusations from former partners that he hid millions in assets. Avenatti also split with Daniels in recent weeks.  Daniels said Monday she was \"saddened but not shocked\" by news of Avenatti's arrest, and that he had dealt with her \"extremely dishonestly.\"  Despite the recent setbacks, Avenatti was back on Twitter less than 24 hours after his arrest, saying Nike had made payments to the mother of Phoenix Suns player DeAndre Ayton while he was a college player and to University of Oregon center Bol Bol.  \"A lot of people at Nike will have to account for their criminal conduct, starting with Carlton DeBose & moving higher up. The diversion charade they orchestrated against me will be exposed,\" he tweeted. DeBose is the head of Nike's youth basketball division.  A Nike spokesperson on Tuesday referred to a company statement that it has been cooperating with a government investigation into NCAA basketball for more than a year, and would not \"be extorted or hide information\" relevant to that probe.  The case is U.S. v. Avenatti, case number 19-mj-2927, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.            \n\nEXTORTION – AVANATTI\n\n\n\nHow Avenatti May Have Crossed The Line Into Extortion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Andrew Strickler \n\n\n\nShare us on: By Andrew Strickler \n\n\n\nLaw360 (March 26, 2019, 9:52 PM EDT) -- A day after being accused of trying to extort Nike, attorney and President Donald Trump antagonist Michael Avenatti was on the offensive Tuesday with allegations of corruption on the part of the company, but those counterpunches likely won't help him dodge federal charges that he went beyond hardball advocacy.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, Avenatti pressed Nike to pay him millions of dollars as an \"internal investigator\" in addition to the much smaller figure he demanded from the sports gear giant for his youth basketball coach client.\n\nThe lack of nexus between his client's alleged injury at Nike's hands and Avenatti's demand for eight-figure fees as an investigator puts the allegations well beyond the realm of aggressive posturing and into the parameters of federal extortion statutes, said criminal defense attorney Jeremy Saland of Crotty Saland PC.\n\n\"Being a blowhard is not illegal, but whether what he's claiming Nike did is fact or fiction doesn't justify trying to enrich himself with a job that doesn't help remedy a wrong suffered by a client,\" Saland said.\n\nOn Monday, federal officials in New York arrested Avenatti, charging the pugnacious Los Angeles lawyer with threatening Nike with a stock-price-sinking press conference about recruitment misconduct if it didn't pay up.\n\nAvenatti, who purported to be representing the coach of a youth basketball team once sponsored by Nike, demanded $1.5 million for the client, who had recently seen Nike drop its support, according to the charges.

If that element of the charges is well-founded, it would effectively leave Avenatti without a \"cloak of legitimacy\" that he was acting solely to resolve a dispute on behalf of his client.\n\nThe complaint \"doesn't even refer to anticipated litigation. It's just, 'I'm going to reveal embarrassing information unless you pay me.' And once you start asking for money for yourself like that, you trend into extortion,\" Felsenstein said.\n\nBarry Temkin of Mound Cotton Wollan & Greengrass LLP similarly characterized the alleged scheme as \"brazen,\" and voiced doubt Avenatti would be able to argue that he could pressure Nike to hire him as an investigator and stay within the legal lines.\n\n\"He's going to them with a demand that they hire him even as he's threatening them with this press conference, which is screwed up on a lot of levels,\" he said. \"It's ambulance chasing, which is unethical. It's a conflict of interest, and who would want to hire someone to do an internal investigation who is also shaking them down?\"\n\nAvenatti was arrested Monday just after he announced via Twitter an impending press conference about a \"major high school/college basketball scandal\" and criminal conduct \"at the highest levels of Nike.\"\n\nIn an unrelated action, federal officials in California charged Avenatti on Monday with defrauding a client out of a $1.6 million settlement and lying to a Mississippi bank to secure loans for his firm and a coffee business.\n\nAvenatti was released in New York later in the day after posting a $300,000 bond. He is due in court on the California case on Monday. He did not respond to multiple requests for comment Tuesday. A message seeking comment from Geragos was also not returned.\n\nAvenatti shot to national prominence last year representing Stormy Daniels, the porn actress who took $130,000 from Trump lawyer Michael Cohen to stay quiet about her affair with the future president and then sued to void the deal.\n\nThe brash lawyer seemed to relish needling Trump and others on countless cable news appearances and on Twitter. He also faced mounting legal troubles in the form of a $10 million judgment stemming from the breakup of his old firm, Eagan Avenatti LLP, and accusations from former partners that he hid millions in assets. Avenatti also split with Daniels in recent weeks.\n\nDaniels said Monday she was \"saddened but not shocked\" by news of Avenatti's arrest, and that he had dealt with her \"extremely dishonestly.\"\n\nDespite the recent setbacks, Avenatti was back on Twitter less than 24 hours after his arrest, saying Nike had made payments to the mother of Phoenix Suns player DeAndre Ayton while he was a college player and to University of Oregon center Bol Bol.\n\n\"A lot of people at Nike will have to account for their criminal conduct, starting with Carlton DeBose & moving higher up. The diversion charade they orchestrated against me will be exposed,\" he tweeted. DeBose is the head of Nike's youth basketball division.\n\nA Nike spokesperson on Tuesday referred to a company statement that it has been cooperating with a government investigation into NCAA basketball for more than a year, and would not \"be extorted or hide information\" relevant to that probe.\n\nThe case is U.S. v. Avenatti, case number 19-mj-2927, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNA\n\nFrom: \n\nTo: \n\nCC: NA\n\nSubject: NA\n\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031787\n\nFrom: \nSent: \nTo: \nNicholas Ribis \n5/29/2019 2:14:44 PM \nImportance: High \nMueller statement at 11am will be interesting - 1 think it's because of Michael wolff's new book and the \nreference to a draft indictment- it probably will be helpful to arr - talk after \nsent from my iPhone \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031787 \n\n\n\nNA\n\nFrom: NA\n\nTo: NA\n\nCC: NA\n\nSubject: NA\n\n1.1pule par une actrice porno  Jeffrey Epstein, P-DG  de Financial Trust Ce  mehardaire amercain, grand  anti de Bill Clinton at du duc  d'Yorh, a die condamne en  2008 a 18 mois de prison at  a dO payer des diatines de  millions de dollars.

The Weekly Standard   The Illusion of Peace with Syria   Elliott Abrams      May 23, 2011 -- The news from Syria grows grimmer by the day—more peaceful protesters killed, ten thousand arrested in the past week, army units shelling residential neighborhoods.    But the Obama administration’s response has not grown grimmer or louder. As recently as May 6, Secretary of State Clinton was still talking about a “reform agenda” in Syria, as if Bashar al-Assad were a slightly misguided bureaucrat rather than the murderer of roughly 1,000 unarmed demonstrators. As for the president, though the White House has issued a couple of statements in his name, he has yet to say one word on camera about the bloodletting in Syria. This is not a small matter, for a tough statement attacking the regime’s repression and giving the demonstrators moral support would immediately circulate over the Internet. American sanctions against Syria, meanwhile, have not named Assad, and there has been no call for him to step down.   Why is the administration appearing to stick with Assad and refusing to call for his ouster? A key reason may be the hope that an Israeli-Syrian peace deal can be arranged.    From the day it came to office, the Obama administration clearly wanted to win an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement. There has been no progress during its two years in office, mostly because the White House insisted on a 100 percent construction freeze in the West Bank settlements and Jerusalem as a precondition for negotiations. This was politically impossible in Israel, and also meant that Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas could not come to the table lest he appear to be asking less from Israel than the Americans.   With negotiations frozen, the Palestinians turned to unilateral measures: seeking a United Nations vote admitting the State of Palestine to membership and getting dozens of countries to recognize a Palestinian state. Meanwhile, their delegitimization campaign against Israel continued apace, especially in Europe, where calls for boycotts and sanctions spread. On the pro-Israel side there was also consideration of unilateral measures—steps to head off the Palestinians diplomatically (several of which I described and supported in the April 11 Weekly Standard).   Some forlorn hope may still have existed inside the administration that a compromise on construction could bring the Palestinians back to the table with the government of Israel—until the agreement between Hamas and Fatah was signed on April 27. This agreement, unless and until it collapses, makes Israeli concessions or new flexibility in the West Bank impossible and puts paid to the entire “peace process.” It brings Hamas into the Palestinian Authority government, ending a period of several years when Palestinian Security Forces have cooperated with the Israel Defense Forces against terrorism and against Hamas in particular. It will also bring Hamas—next year and for the first time—into the PLO, the body charged with negotiating peace with Israel. Even Yasser Arafat resisted that development when he headed the PLO, and it seems obvious that Israel cannot negotiate peace with an anti-Semitic terrorist group bent on its destruction.   So where can the White House turn if it wants some kind of peace process in the Middle East? Syria. After all, in his first term as prime minister, back in 1998, Benjamin Netanyahu did authorize indirect negotiations with Syria. And the IDF—and especially Ehud Barak, a former head of the IDF, Israel’s defense minister, and a close adviser to Netanyahu—has long favored such a deal. The IDF theory was that if Syria made peace, so would Lebanon, and then Israel would be at peace with all four neighboring Arab states. And it can be argued now that Assad may see negotiations with Israel as a way to climb back from the pariah status he is earning, making him at this juncture truly open to a new peace process.   Such thinking, whether in Jerusalem or the White House, is foolish and even grotesque. There is no possibility that Assad would negotiate seriously and that an agreement could be attained. He is now clinging desperately to power, and his only true allies are Iran and Hezbollah. Yet Israel’s (and, one hopes, our own) key precondition to any agreement would necessarily be a clean break in those relationships: an end to the Syrian alliance with Hezbollah and Iran. Otherwise Israel would be giving the Golan, in effect, to Iran—a suicidal act. No Israeli government would do it, which suggests that negotiations with Assad would have no purpose.   Assad may indeed be open to commencing a negotiation as a means to escape international isolation, but that’s all the more reason not to give it to him. Prime Minister Ehud Olmert’s 2008 talks with Syria (via Turkey) allowed Syria to escape the partial isolation the United States had imposed on it in that decade, with zero gain for Israel. This is not an experiment worth repeating, for the Assad regime is today even more despicable than it was three years ago.   To react to the murders now taking place all over Syria by embracing the Assad regime would be morally indefensible. Whether Assad can be overthrown soon by the people of Syria is a fair question to ask. Will the army stay with him, or will Sunni units rebel? Will the Sunni business elites turn against him? How long can the regime survive? We do not yet know the answers. But surely we must avoid any step that could help Assad, rehabilitate his regime, or undermine the courageous struggle of peaceful demonstrators in the streets of Syria.    The peace agreements that Israel signed with Egypt and Jordan were real achievements, but there will be no such agreements with the Palestinians or with Syria in the foreseeable future. The Palestinians have taken themselves out of the game for now. We cannot turn from them to the Syrians while Assad’s troops are using howitzers and sniper rifles against his people. This is the time not for diplomatic engagement with Assad, but for diplomacy aimed at quarantining his regime and helping bring it down. The White House should dismiss any remaining dreams of a “peace process” with Syria to substitute for the Palestinian version and face facts: There will be no peace with the butcher who rules Syria today.

The Daily Star   A democratic Arab world would welcome peace with Israel Hamid Alkifaey  One could reasonably argue that the golden opportunity for peace in the Middle East was blown away when Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated on Nov. 4, 1995.  He was the only Israeli leader capable of making peace with the Palestinians, and was about to do so had it not been for the bullets of Yigal Amir, the right-wing religious zealot who believed in the “winner takes all” principle.  One could also claim that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and its global ramifications are responsible for agitating religious extremism in the Muslim world as a whole, and among Palestinians in particular. Prior to 1987, there was hardly any Islamic factor in Palestinian resistance. The Hamas and Islamic Jihad groups were established after the 1987 intifada. From this we deduce that extremism on the Israeli side led to the same on the Palestinian side, and consequently in other Muslim countries, which manifests in popular opposition to traditional and despotic regimes. The Arab world is currently going through a social and political revolution that has so far claimed two “entrenched” regimes in Tunisia and Egypt. At least three other regimes in the region are fighting for their lives, and are not expected to survive. There will soon be different styles of government in Libya, Yemen and Syria. This much is certain.  Will there be a different policy toward Israel? Certainly. But this will take time to take shape, since there are more pressing national priorities, such as political and economic reforms. Israel has long branded the Arab world as tribal and undemocratic, in order to brand itself the only democracy in the Middle East. Well, soon enough it won’t be. Many of its neighbors will soon join the democratic world as demands for democracy grow. Democracy will mean more development, prosperity and people’s power. It means more popular participation in decision making and awareness of the possibilities of the nation and what it can and cannot do. It may not mean more hostility toward Israel if the latter knows how to deal with it. But there will be tension if Israel continues to follow extreme policies, which it will under the current leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu.  The Palestinians must achieve their right to establish their own state on their land. This right has been recognized by almost everyone except a minority of extremists in Israel, led by Netanyahu. Free and democratic Arab countries won’t shrink from supporting this Palestinian right under any circumstances. Muslims will not give up on East Jerusalem, either. Arab regimes have been weak in the past. Democracy will strengthen them, but also add reason to Arab governance. Most Arabs have accepted Israel’s right to exist, and accepted U.N. resolutions 242 and 338, but Israeli intransigence is not helping them formulate a unified position.  Democratic Egypt won’t be a threat to Israel as the Egyptian military, which will continue to be highly influential in Egypt’s politics in the foreseeable future, will not risk another war with Israel. Egyptians under a democratic regime will be seeking better living standards, better laws to govern the country and more rights as citizens. They won’t be pressing their government to fight Israel; on the contrary, they want a stable economy where things will be better for future generations. But Israel may aggravate the situation by electing extremists and following extreme policies. This will strengthen the hands of the hawks in the Arab world. Moderate Israel under reasonable and realistic leaders should have nothing to fear from Egypt, with which it has an enduring peace treaty.  The situation with Syria may not be exactly the same, however, especially when the two countries are still officially in a state of war. The regime of Bashar Assad, and his father before him, would have never started a war with Israel unilaterally. It also suited them not to have a peace treaty. Any new Syrian leader is not likely (for a considerable period of time) to initiate a move toward a peace agreement with Israel as this will weaken his position domestically. Nor will he launch a war, however, since such a war will not result in victory. A democratic regime in Syria, or any other Arab country for that matter, will need a good 10 years to build democratic institutions and stabilize a modern market economy needed in any democracy. So, war won’t be on the agenda in the near future. Prosperity increases the public’s stake in a stable economy, and this will make people want to compromise to make their country more prosperous and stable. However, everything will depend on how prepared the free world is to help new democracies in the Middle East survive and prosper. Small Islamic groups, organized and armed with religious zeal, could hijack power from the moderates. This would lead to a disaster for the whole region. Therefore, it is imperative for the free world, Israel included, not to leave matters to chance. A proactive stance is needed to nurture democracy and help moderate forces organize themselves in order to govern the region  Hamid Alkifaey is a writer and journalist.

The Daily Beast    The Awkward Exit of Mideast Envoy George Mitchell   Daniel Stone      May 13, 2011 -- Two days after Barack Obama's inauguration, George Mitchell was named special envoy for Middle East peace. With the new president standing beside Mitchell and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Vice President Joe Biden took the podium and extolled Mitchell's reputation and experience having brokered peace in Northern Ireland, calling him an \"outstanding public servant\" with \"incredible capacity.\" In the press, Mitchell was praised as the right man for the job at the right time.   On Friday, though, that capacity had reached its limit, and Mitchell told his bosses in the West Wing that he'd had enough. His reasons, he said, were personal—the kind of nebulous rationale that leaves ample room for interpretation. Unmentioned were the months of frustration that Mitchell had built up as direct negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians became more difficult and the peace process further off.   The timing of Mitchell's departure couldn't be more awkward. Obama will meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Jordan's King Abdullah next week, as well as deliver a major speech on Middle East policy. But the resignation didn't come as a surprise to those who worked closest with Mitchell. A State Department official described to Newsweek a man increasingly annoyed by both parties' constant moving of the goal posts and the constraints of the administration's unshakeable political instinct to support Israel.   The strain was noticeable in the Middle East. In a recent interview with Newsweek, one senior Israeli official said Mitchell often would say one thing about the direction the U.S. was taking with the two sides, only to be contradicted by Dennis Ross, Clinton's special adviser to the region. The official, who did not want to be quoted by name, said it seemed as if Mitchell had abdicated his role completely in recent months. Indeed, Mitchell's frequent visits to Israel and the West Bank slowed to a trickle; his last visit to the region was in December.   When he was there, officials on both sides of the conflict had voiced bewilderment at Mitchell's hands-off approach to the complex negotiating process. With a small staff in Israel, he would shuttle between Jerusalem and Ramallah to meet with senior advisers to the leaders of both sides and then leave after just a few days. In an interview with Newsweek last month, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas openly accused Mitchell of not doing his job. \"Every visit by Mitchell, we talked to him and gave him some ideas,\" he said. \"At the end we discovered that he didn't convey any of these ideas to the Israelis. What does it mean?\"   A politically attuned man who was once Senate Majority Leader, Mitchell was aware of the complaints about him. His usual comeback was to point to his success in Northern Ireland, which earned him the Presidential Medal of Freedom. For hundreds of days, he liked to say, he was considered a failure, until the final day, when he actually got it done.   Mitchell's resignation letter set off a small panic inside the West Wing earlier in the week. Senior advisers, as well as Obama himself, could sense the increasing difficulty of the job: Administration officials had been unable to convince Israel to halve new settlements in the West Bank, alienating Palestinians, and Israelis were irked in early May when Abbas allied with Hamas, a group that refuses to denounce violence against Israel. But the symbolism of Mitchell leaving several days before Obama's biggest week of outreach to the region projected a vacuum of confidence that anything hopeful, however remote, was on the horizon.   \"He wouldn't be leaving at this important hour if he knew there was going to be a significant change in the administration's attitude toward the peace process,\" said Middle East analyst Gregory Orfalea, who formerly taught at Georgetown's School of Foreign Service. \"He's leaving because it's status quo.\"   Mitchell will be replaced—in the interim by his deputy, David Hale—and another official will take a crack at the quandary. But despite new momentum from Netanyahu's visit next week and Obama's speech Thursday, Mitchell's departure could signal stagnant talks for the next several years. According to Fawaz Gerges, director of the London School of Economics' Middle East Center, \"the reality is that, with Mitchell leaving, Barack Obama basically lost the ideological battle [over how to confront the peace process]. By now he'll have to wait for the second term before you can get another concerted effort.\"      Daniel Stone is Newsweek's White House correspondent.

The Washington Post   Amid the Arab Spring, a U.S.-Saudi split   Nawaf Obaid      May 16 - RIYADH, SAUDI ARABIA -- A tectonic shift has occurred in the U.S.-Saudi relationship. Despite significant pressure from the Obama administration to remain on the sidelines, Saudi leaders sent troops into Manama in March to defend Bahrain’s monarchy and quell the unrest that has shaken that country since February. For more than 60 years, Saudi Arabia has been bound by an unwritten bargain: oil for security. Riyadh has often protested but ultimately acquiesced to what it saw as misguided U.S. policies. But American missteps in the region since Sept. 11, an ill-conceived response to the Arab protest movements and an unconscionable refusal to hold Israel accountable for its illegal settlement building have brought this arrangement to an end. As the Saudis recalibrate the partnership, Riyadh intends to pursue a much more assertive foreign policy, at times conflicting with American interests. The backdrop for this change are the rise of Iranian meddling in the region and the counterproductive policies that the United States has pursued here since Sept. 11. The most significant blunder may have been the invasion of Iraq, which resulted in enormous loss of life and provided Iran an opening to expand its sphere of influence. For years, Iran’s leadership has aimed to foment discord while furthering its geopolitical ambitions. Tehran has long funded Hamas and Hezbollah; recently, its scope of attempted interference has broadened to include the affairs of Arab states from Yemen to Morocco. This month the chief of staff of Iran’s armed forces, Gen. Hasan Firouzabadi, harshly criticized Riyadh over its intervention in Bahrain, claiming this act would spark massive domestic uprisings.   Such remarks are based more on wishful thinking than fact, but Iran’s efforts to destabilize its neighbors are tireless. As Riyadh fights a cold war with Tehran, Washington has shown itself in recent months to be an unwilling and unreliable partner against this threat. The emerging political reality is a Saudi-led Arab world facing off against the aggression of Iran and its non-state proxies. Saudi Arabia will not allow the political unrest in the region to destabilize the Arab monarchies — the Gulf states, Jordan and Morocco. In Yemen, the Saudis are insisting on an orderly transition of power and a dignified exit for President Ali Abdullah Saleh (a courtesy that was not extended to Hosni Mubarak, despite the former Egyptian president’s many years as a strong U.S. ally). To facilitate this handover, Riyadh is leading a diplomatic effort under the auspices of the six-country Gulf Cooperation Council. In Iraq, the Saudi government will continue to pursue a hard-line stance against the Maliki government, which it regards as little more than an Iranian puppet. In Lebanon, Saudi Arabia will act to check the growth of Hezbollah and to ensure that this Iranian proxy does not dominate the country’s political life. Regarding the widespread upheaval in Syria, the Saudis will work to ensure that any potential transition to a post-Assad era is as peaceful and as free of Iranian meddling as possible.  Regarding Israel, Riyadh is adamant that a just settlement, based on King Abdullah’s proposed peace plan, be implemented. This includes a Palestinian state with its capital in East Jerusalem. The United States has lost all credibility on this issue; after casting the sole vote in the U.N. Security Council against censuring Israel for its illegal settlement building, it can no longer act as an objective mediator. This act was a watershed in U.S.-Saudi relations, guaranteeing that Saudi leaders will not push for further compromise from the Palestinians, despite American pressure.   Saudi Arabia remains strong and stable, lending muscle to its invigorated foreign policy. Spiritually, the kingdom plays a unique role for the world’s 1.2 billion Muslims — more than 1 billion of whom are Sunni — as the birthplace of Islam and home of the two holiest cities. Politically, its leaders enjoy broad domestic support, and a growing nationalism has knitted the historically tribal country more closely together. This is largely why widespread protests, much anticipated by Western media in March, never materialized. As the world’s sole energy superpower and the de facto central banker of the global energy markets, Riyadh is the economic powerhouse of the Middle East, representing 25 percent of the combined gross domestic product of the Arab world. The kingdom has amassed more than $550 billion in foreign reserves and is spending more than $150 billion to improve infrastructure, public education, social services and health care.  To counter the threats posed by Iran and transnational terrorist networks, the Saudi leadership is authorizing more than $100 billion of additional military spending to modernize ground forces, upgrade naval capabilities and more. The kingdom is doubling its number of high-quality combat aircraft and adding 60,000 security personnel to the Interior Ministry forces. Plans are underway to create a “Special Forces Command,” based on the U.S. model, to unify the kingdom’s various special forces if needed for rapid deployment abroad. Saudi Arabia has the will and the means to meet its expanded global responsibilities. In some issues, such as counterterrorism and efforts to fight money laundering, the Saudis will continue to be a strong U.S. partner. In areas in which Saudi national security or strategic interests are at stake, the kingdom will pursue its own agenda. With Iran working tirelessly to dominate the region, the Muslim Brotherhood rising in Egypt and unrest on nearly every border, there is simply too much at stake for the kingdom to rely on a security policy written in Washington, which has backfired more often than not and spread instability. The special relationship may never be the same, but from this transformation a more stable and secure Middle East can be born.

Newsweek   Dr. K’s Rx for China   Niall Ferguson      May 15, 2011  -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton thinks the Chinese government is “scared” of the Arab Spring. “They’re worried,” she told Jeffrey Goldberg in the latest Atlantic, “and they are trying to stop history, which is a fool’s errand. They cannot do it.”   These are words—intemperate, undiplomatic, and very likely counterproductive—that you cannot imagine being uttered by her predecessor Henry Kissinger. It is now 40 years since Kissinger went on his secret mission to China, to pave the way for President Richard Nixon’s historic visit the following year. Since then he has visited the country more than 50 times. And if there is one thing he has learned, it is this: the real fool’s errand is to lean on the Chinese. Much has changed in the world since Kissinger’s first trip to China. (In 1971, who would have dared to predict that America’s public enemy No. 1 would be a Saudi-born Islamic fundamentalist skulking in a walled compound in Pakistan?) But at least two things in American foreign policy remain consistent: the relationship with mainland China, revived by Kissinger after more than 20 years in the deep freeze, and Kissinger himself, consulted formally or informally by every president from John F. Kennedy to Barack Obama. On China, Kissinger’s new book, is a reminder of why our leaders still want to pick his brains. Eighty-eight years old this month, he remains without equal as a strategic thinker.  The opening to China is a story Kissinger has told before: how he and Nixon had discerned that country could become a strategic counterweight to the Soviet Union; how he secretly flew to China after feigning illness in Pakistan; how he and Premier Zhou Enlai hammered out the diplomatic basis for Nixon’s official visit (the Shanghai Communiqué). The result was, as he puts it, “a quasi alliance,” which, though initially intended to contain the Soviet Union, ended up outliving the Cold War.   In this telling, however, Kissinger is able to take advantage of recent research that illuminates the Chinese side of the story. The American opening to China was also a Chinese opening to America, actuated above all by Mao Zedong’s fear of encirclement. “Think about this,” Mao told his doctor in 1969. “We have the Soviet Union to the north and the west, India to the south, and Japan to the east. If all our enemies were to unite, attacking us from the north, south, east, and west, what do you think we should do?” The medic had no idea. “Think again,” said Mao. “Beyond Japan is the United States. Didn’t our ancestors counsel negotiating with faraway countries while fighting with those that are near?” It was to explore the American option that Mao recalled four Army marshals from exile. Skirmishes were already underway between Soviet and Chinese forces on the Ussuri River. In October 1970 Mao ordered China’s top leadership to evacuate Beijing and put the People’s Liberation Army on “first-degree combat readiness.” The stakes for China were high indeed—higher than for the United States.  As Kissinger shows, it was far from unusual for Mao to refer to “our ancestors’ counsel.” Despite his lifelong commitment to Marxism-Leninism, Mao was also steeped in the classics of Chinese civilization, as were his close advisers. “We can consult the example of Zhuge Liang’s strategic guiding principle,” Marshal Ye Jian-ying suggested, “when the three states of Wei, Shu, and Wu confronted each other: ‘Ally with Wu in the east to oppose Wei in the north.’ ” The allusion, Kissinger explains, is to Romance of the Three Kingdoms, a 14th-century epic novel set in the so-called Warring States period (475–221 B.C.).   Nor was this the only occasion when China’s communist leaders looked to the distant past for inspiration. Of equal importance to them, Kissinger argues, was The Art of War by Sun Tzu, which dates from the even earlier Spring and Autumn period (770–476 B.C.). “The victorious army/Is victorious first/And seeks battle later”: axioms like this one encouraged Chinese strategists to think of international relations like the board game Weiqi (known in the West as Go), a “game of surrounding pieces.”   Mao shared with China’s prerevolutionary leaders an assumption that China is not like other countries. With a population that amounts to a fifth of humanity, it is Zhongguo: the Middle Kingdom or, perhaps more accurately, the “Central Country.” At times it could even seem like tian xia: “all under heaven.” The best foreign policy for such an empire was to “let barbarians fight barbarians.” If that failed, then the strongest of the barbarians should be embraced and civilized (as happened to the Manchus).   “Domineering and overwhelming … ruthless and aloof, poet and warrior, prophet and scourge”—Mao’s true hero was not Lenin but the tyrannical, book-burning “first emperor,” Qin Shi Huang, who united China in 221 B.C. In a similar way, Kissinger shows, the current generation of Chinese leaders have drawn inspiration from the teachings of Kong Fu Zi (known in the West as Confucius). Their goal, he argues, is not world domination but da tong: “great harmony.”   This goes to the heart of the matter. In 1971, when Kissinger first went to China, the U.S. economy was roughly five times that of the People’s Republic. Forty years later, as a result of the industrial revolution unleashed by Mao’s successor Deng Xiao-ping, it is conceivable that China could overtake America within a decade. This is a feat the Soviet Union never came close to achieving. Moreover, China is now the biggest foreign holder of U.S. Treasury notes, which form an important part of its vast $3 trillion of international reserves. How China will use its newfound economic power may be the most important question of our time. Few Americans are better placed to answer that question than Kissinger, who has dealt with four generations of Chinese leaders.   The most profound insights of On China are psychological. They concern the fundamental cultural differences between a Chinese elite who can look back more than two millennia for inspiration and an American elite whose historical frame of reference is little more than two centuries old. This became most obvious in the wake of June 1989, when Americans recoiled from the use of military force to end the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy demonstrations. To Kissinger’s eyes, it was doubly naive to retaliate to this crackdown with sanctions: “Western concepts of human rights and individual liberties may not be directly translatable … to a civilization for millennia ordered around different concepts. Nor can the traditional Chinese fear of political chaos be dismissed as an anachronistic irrelevancy needing only ‘correction’ by Western enlightenment.”   As China’s first Anglophone leader, Jiang Zemin, explained to Kissinger in 1991: “We never submit to pressure … It is a philosophical principle.”   The United States and China went to war in Korea because of another cultural gap. It came as a surprise to the Americans when Mao ordered Chinese intervention because the military odds looked so unfavorable. But, argues Kissinger, his “motivating force was less to inflict a decisive military first blow than to change the psychological balance, not so much to defeat the enemy as to alter his calculus of risks.” Mao was a master of the ancient Empty City Stratagem, which seeks to conceal weakness with a show of confidence, even aggression. To Westerners, his insistence that he did not fear a nuclear attack seemed unhinged or, at best, callous (“We may lose more than 300 million people. So what? War is war. The years will pass, and we’ll get to work producing more babies than ever before”). But this was classical Chinese bravado, or “offensive deterrence.”    “Chinese negotiators,” observes Kissinger in a passage that should be inwardly digested not just by American diplomats but also by American businessmen before they land in Beijing, “use diplomacy to weave together political, military, and psychological elements into an overall strategic design.” American diplomacy, by contrast, “generally prefers …c to be ‘flexible’; it feels an obligation to break deadlocks with new proposals—unintentionally inviting new deadlocks to elicit new proposals.” We could learn a thing or two from the Chinese, Kissinger implies, particularly Sun Tzu’s concept of shi, meaning the “potential energy” of the overall strategic landscape. Our tendency is to have an agenda of 10 different points, each one to be dealt with separately. They have one big game plan. We are always in a hurry for closure, anxiously watching the minutes tick away. The Chinese value patience; as Mao explained to Kissinger, they measure time in millennia.   Such fundamental cultural differences may give rise to conflict with China in the future, Kissinger warns: “When the Chinese view of preemption encounters the Western concept of deterrence, a vicious circle can result: acts conceived as defensive in China may be treated as aggressive by the outside world; deterrent moves by the West may be interpreted in China as encirclement. The United States and China wrestled with this dilemma repeatedly during the Cold War; to some extent they have not yet found a way to transcend it.”   Could the United States and the People’s Republic come to blows again? The possibility cannot be excluded. As Kissinger reminds us, war was the result when Germany rose to challenge Britain economically and geopolitically 100 years ago. Moreover, the key factor that brought America and China together in the 1970s—the common Soviet enemy the Chinese called “the polar bear”—has vanished from the scene. Old, intractable differences persist over Taiwan and North Korea. What remains is “Chimerica,” a less-than-happy marriage of economic convenience in which one partner does all the saving and the other does all the spending.   In Kissinger’s own words, China’s rise could “make international relations bipolar again,” ushering in a new cold (or possibly even hot) war. Nationalist writers like Liu Mingfu, author of China Dream, urge China to switch from “peaceful development” to “military rise” and look forward to the “duel of the century” with the United States. There are those in Washington, too—apparently including, for the moment, the Obama administration—who would relish a more confrontational relationship.   Yet Kissinger remains hopeful that cooler heads will prevail in Beijing: thinkers like Zheng Bijian, who urges China to “transcend the traditional ways for great powers to emerge” and “not [to] follow the path of Germany leading up to World War I.” Rather than attempting to “organize Asia on the basis of containing China or creating a bloc of democratic states for an ideological crusade,” the United States would do better, Kissinger suggests, to work with China to build a new “Pacific Community.”   Four decades ago, Richard Nixon grasped sooner than most the huge potential of China. “Well,” he mused, “you can just stop and think of what could happen if anybody with a decent system of government got control of that mainland. Good God … There’d be no power in the world that could even—I mean, you put 800 million Chinese to work under a decent system … and they will be the leaders of the world.” That prophecy is being fulfilled in our time. The fact that until now China’s rise has been a boon to the United States rather than a bane owes much to the work of Henry Kissinger. With this book he has given his successors an indispensable guide to continuing the Sino-American “coevolution” he began.      Ferguson is writing a biography of Henry Kissinger.       \fArticle 6.   Hurriyet Daily News   Syria as Turkey’s domestic issue   Yusuf Kanli  May 15, 2011 -- Syria is no Libya for many reasons; not just because it is a country right on the Turkish border or, like Turkey, it has a Kurdish population and an explosion there may ignite an explosion on this side of the border as well.   Like a broken watch that shows correct time twice a day, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan as well occasionally makes some correct analysis. Last week, while comparing the uprising in Libya against the Moammar Gadhafi regime and the growing unrest in the Syrian street against the Baathist regime of Bashar al-Assad, the prime minister correctly said Libya and Syria were two totally different issues for Turkey.   Erdoğan explained while Turkey was very much concerned with what’s happening in Libya and have been undertaking every possible effort to contribute to a quick end to the tumult and restoration of peace and order in Libya, Syria was very much like a domestic incident for Turkey.   As part of its neo-Ottoman drive to enhance its influence in the Middle Eastern territory of the former Ottoman Empire the ruling Justice and development Party, or AKP, government of Turkey has long waived visa requirement in travel between Turkey and Syria. The aim behind that move was to plant the seeds of a future European Union-like Middle Eastern union led by Turkey but the first tangible result was not a marked increase in commercial, business or tourist interactions, but a batch of 250 refugees running from the fire on the Syrian street.   If the problem continues and escalates further in the Syrian street it is probable that the prefabricated facility in the Hatay province constructed to provide temporary lodging to pilgrims during the Hajj season will not suffice in providing a shelter to Syrian refugees who thanks to the no-visa regime in travel between Turkey and Syria may freely escape to Turkey from the trouble in their own street and thus carry the problem to the Turkish street.   For now the separatist Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, terrorists are abiding with an unilateral truce, which is claimed to have been negotiated with the government by Abdullah Öcalan, the chieftain of the gang serving an enforced life term on the İmralı island prison, which according to claims will last until June 15, three days after the June 12 parliamentary elections. Indeed, excluding some rehearsal for a possible mass civilian disobedience campaign after the elections and some exceptional terrorist acts, it might be said that there is nothing extraordinary in Turkey’s southeast bordering Syria, Iraq and Iran, where there are sizeable Kurdish populations.   The “success” of the unrest in Syrian streets in uprooting the government might mean added trouble for Turkey, which has been battling with separatist terrorism for the past 25 years. Turkey remaining silent or supportive of the Assad regime crushing the pressure for a regime change and reform calls of the Syrian street, on the other hand, would seriously imperil the regional role aspired by the AKP governance of Turkey.   Indeed, while the AKP government in Ankara joined the calls of the U.S.-led coalition of the willing that time is up for Moammar Gadhafi in Libya and for peace and safety of his own people Gadhafi must step down, as regards to Syria Ankara, as well as the Western alliance, has been restraining their calls with a shy request from Assad to accelerate reforms.   While Ankara may answer anti-Turkish demonstrations in Libya by closing down the Turkish embassy in Tripoli, the first ever such action by the diplomatic service throughout its modern history, anti-Turkish demonstrations in Damascus can be really costly for Turkey now and in the future.   While the personal friendly relations between Assad and his counterpart in Turkey, Erdoğan, might provide Turkey a golden opportunity to help Syria sail out of the current tumultuous situation. Of course at a time when Erdoğan himself is after converting Turkey into his sultanate of fear under the aegis of advanced democracy it might be absurd to expect him to advise Assad of a democratic way out of the mess in Syria. Yet, as much as Turkey needs to see restoration of peace, security and stability in Syria for domestic security reasons as well as for its regional role, Syria and President Assad need Turkey and Erdoğan to walk the extra mile in reforms advised by them, as the real-politic of the day compels him to do so if he wants to sail out of this problem in one piece.   If, however, despite Turkey’s democracy and reform preaches, the massacres continue in the Syrian street not only the prestige of Erdoğan in the Arab street will be seriously impaired but sooner or later the fire in the Arab street will have a reflection on the Turkish streets.       \fArticle 7.   STRATFOR   The Geopolitics of Israel: Biblical and Modern       The founding principle of geopolitics is that place — geography — plays a significant role in determining how nations will behave. If that theory is true, then there ought to be a deep continuity in a nation's foreign policy. Israel is a laboratory for this theory, since it has existed in three different manifestations in roughly the same place, twice in antiquity and once in modernity. If geopolitics is correct, then Israeli foreign policy, independent of policymakers, technology or the identity of neighbors, ought to have important common features. This is, therefore, a discussion of common principles in Israeli foreign policy over nearly 3,000 years.  For convenience, we will use the term \"Israel\" to connote all of the Hebrew and Jewish entities that have existed in the Levant since the invasion of the region as chronicled in the Book of Joshua. As always, geopolitics requires a consideration of three dimensions: the internal geopolitics of Israel, the interaction of Israel and the immediate neighbors who share borders with it, and Israel's interaction with what we will call great powers, beyond Israel's borderlands.  Israel has manifested itself three times in history. The first manifestation began with the invasion led by Joshua and lasted through its division into two kingdoms, the Babylonian conquest of the Kingdom of Judah and the deportation to Babylon early in the sixth century B.C. The second manifestation began when Israel was recreated in 540 B.C. by the Persians, who had defeated the Babylonians. The nature of this second manifestation changed in the fourth century B.C., when Greece overran the Persian Empire and Israel, and again in the first century B.C., when the Romans conquered the region.  The second manifestation saw Israel as a small actor within the framework of larger imperial powers, a situation that lasted until the destruction of the Jewish vassal state by the Romans.  Israel's third manifestation began in 1948, following (as in the other cases) an ingathering of t least some of the Jews who had been dispersed after conquests. Israel's founding takes place in the context of the decline and fall of the British Empire and must, at least in part, be understood as part of British imperial history.  During its first 50 years, Israel plays a pivotal role in the confrontation of the United States and the Soviet Union and, in some senses, is hostage to the dynamics of these two countries. In other words, like the first two manifestations of Israel, the third finds Israel continually struggling among independence, internal tension and imperial ambition. Israeli Geography and Borderlands  At its height, under King David, Israel extended from the Sinai to the Euphrates, encompassing Damascus. It occupied some, but relatively little, of the coastal region, an area beginning at what today is Haifa and running south to Jaffa, just north of today's Tel Aviv. The coastal area to the north was held by Phoenicia, the area to the south by Philistines. It is essential to understand that Israel's size and shape shifted over time. For example, Judah under the Hasmoneans did not include the Negev but did include the Golan. The general locale of Israel is fixed. Its precise borders have never been. Thus, it is perhaps better to begin with what never was part of Israel. Israel never included the Sinai Peninsula. Along the coast, it never stretched much farther north than the Litani River in today's Lebanon. Apart from David's extreme extension (and fairly tenuous control) to the north, Israel's territory never stretched as far as Damascus, although it frequently held the Golan Heights. Israel extended many times to both sides of the Jordan but never deep into the Jordanian Desert. It never extended southeast into the Arabian Peninsula.  Israel consists generally of three parts. First, it always has had the northern hill region, stretching from the foothills of Mount Hermon south to Jerusalem. Second, it always contains some of the coastal plain from today's Tel Aviv north to Haifa. Third, it occupies area between Jerusalem and the Jordan River — today's West Bank. At times, it controls all or part of the Negev, including the coastal region between the Sinai to the Tel Aviv area. It may be larger than this at various times in history, and sometimes smaller, but it normally holds all or part of these three regions.  Israel is well-buffered in three directions. The Sinai Desert protects it against the Egyptians. In general, the Sinai has held little attraction for the Egyptians. The difficulty of deploying forces in the eastern Sinai poses severe logistical problems for them, particularly during a prolonged presence. Unless Egypt can rapidly move through the Sinai north into the coastal plain, where it can sustain its forces more readily, deploying in the Sinai is difficult and unrewarding. Therefore, so long as Israel is not so weak as to make an attack on the coastal plain a viable option, or unless Egypt is motivated by an outside imperial power, Israel does not face a threat from the southwest.  Israel is similarly protected from the southeast. The deserts southeast of Eilat-Aqaba are virtually impassable. No large force could approach from that direction, although smaller raiding parties could. The tribes of the Arabian Peninsula lack the reach or the size to pose a threat to Israel, unless massed and aligned with other forces. Even then, the approach from the southeast is not one that they are likely to take. The Negev is secure from that direction.  The eastern approaches are similarly secured by desert, which begins about 20 to 30 miles east of the Jordan River. While indigenous forces exist in the borderland east of the Jordan, they lack the numbers to be able to penetrate decisively west of the Jordan. Indeed, the normal model is that, so long as Israel controls Judea and Samaria (the modern-day West Bank), then the East Bank of the Jordan River is under the political and sometimes military domination of Israel — sometimes directly through settlement, sometimes indirectly through political influence, or economic or security leverage.  Israel's vulnerability is in the north. There is no natural buffer between Phoenicia and its successor entities (today's Lebanon) to the direct north. The best defense line for Israel in the north is the Litani River, but this is not an insurmountable boundary under any circumstance. However, the area along the coast north of Israel does not present a serious threat. The coastal area prospers through trade in the Mediterranean basin. It is oriented toward the sea and to the trade routes to the east, not to the south. If it does anything, this area protects those trade routes and has no appetite for a conflict that might disrupt trade. It stays out of Israel's way, for the most part.  Moreover, as a commercial area, this region is generally wealthy, a factor that increases predators around it and social conflict within. It is an area prone to instability. Israel frequently tries to extend its influence northward for commercial reasons, as one of the predators, and this can entangle Israel in its regional politics. But barring this self-induced problem, the threat to Israel from the north is minimal, despite the absence of natural boundaries and the large population. On occasion, there is spillover of conflicts from the north, but not to a degree that might threaten regime survival in Israel.  The neighbor that is always a threat lies to the northeast. Syria — or, more precisely, the area governed by Damascus at any time — is populous and frequently has no direct outlet to the sea. It is, therefore, generally poor. The area to its north, Asia Minor, is heavily mountainous. Syria cannot project power to the north except with great difficulty, but powers in Asia Minor can move south. Syria's eastern flank is buffered by a desert that stretches to the Euphrates. Therefore, when there is no threat from the north, Syria's interest — after securing itself internally — is to gain access to the coast. Its primary channel is directly westward, toward the rich cities of the northern Levantine coast, with which it trades heavily. An alternative interest is southwestward, toward the southern Levantine coast controlled by Israel.  As can be seen, Syria can be interested in Israel only selectively. When it is interested, it has a serious battle problem. To attack Israel, it would have to strike between Mount Hermon and the Sea of Galilee, an area about 25 miles wide. The Syrians potentially can attack south of the sea, but only if they are prepared to fight through this region and then attack on extended supply lines. If an attack is mounted along the main route, Syrian forces must descend the Golan Heights and then fight through the hilly Galilee before reaching the coastal plain — sometimes with guerrillas holding out in the Galilean hills. The Galilee is an area that is relatively easy to defend and difficult to attack. Therefore, it is only once Syria takes the Galilee, and can control its lines of supply against guerrilla attack, that its real battle begins.  To reach the coast or move toward Jerusalem, Syria must fight through a plain in front of a line of low hills. This is the decisive battleground where massed Israeli forces, close to lines of supply, can defend against dispersed Syrian forces on extended lines of supply. It is no accident that Megiddo — or Armageddon, as the plain is sometimes referred to — has apocalyptic meaning. This is the point at which any move from Syria would be decided. But a Syrian offensive would have a tough fight to reach Megiddo, and a tougher one as it deploys on the plain.  On the surface, Israel lacks strategic depth, but this is true only on the surface. It faces limited threats from southern neighbors. To its east, it faces only a narrow strip of populated area east of the Jordan. To the north, there is a maritime commercial entity. Syria operating alone, forced through the narrow gap of the Mount Hermon-Galilee line and operating on extended supply lines, can be dealt with readily.  There is a risk of simultaneous attacks from multiple directions. Depending on the forces deployed and the degree of coordination between them, this can pose a problem for Israel. However, even here the Israelis have the tremendous advantage of fighting on interior lines. Egypt and Syria, fighting on external lines (and widely separated fronts), would have enormous difficulty transferring forces from one front to another. Israel, on interior lines (fronts close to each other with good transportation), would be able to move its forces from front to front rapidly, allowing for sequential engagement and thereby the defeat of enemies. Unless enemies are carefully coordinated and initiate war simultaneously — and deploy substantially superior force on at least one front — Israel can initiate war at a time of its choosing or else move its forces rapidly between fronts, negating much of the advantage of size that the attackers might have.  There is another aspect to the problem of multifront war. Egypt usually has minimal interests along the Levant, having its own coast and an orientation to the south toward the headwaters of the Nile. On the rare occasions when Egypt does move through the Sinai and attacks to the north and northeast, it is in an expansionary mode. By the time it consolidates and exploits the coastal plain, it would be powerful enough to threaten Syria. From Syria's point of view, the only thing more dangerous than Israel is an Egypt in control of Israel. Therefore, the probability of a coordinated north-south strike at Israel is rare, is rarely coordinated and usually is not designed to be a mortal blow. It is defeated by Israel's strategic advantage of interior lines.  Israeli Geography and the Convergence Zone Therefore, it is not surprising that Israel's first incarnation lasted as long as it did — some five centuries. What is interesting and what must be considered is why Israel (now considered as the northern kingdom) was defeated by the Assyrians and Judea, then defeated by Babylon. To understand this, we need to consider the broader geography of Israel's location.  Israel is located on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea, on the Levant. As we have seen, when Israel is intact, it will tend to be the dominant power in the Levant. Therefore, Israeli resources must generally be dedicated for land warfare, leaving little over for naval warfare. In general, although Israel had excellent harbors and access to wood for shipbuilding, it never was a major Mediterranean naval power. It never projected power into the sea. The area to the north of Israel has always been a maritime power, but Israel, the area south of Mount Hermon, was always forced to be a land power.  The Levant in general and Israel in particular has always been a magnet for great powers. No Mediterranean empire could be fully secure unless it controlled the Levant. Whether it was Rome or Carthage, a Mediterranean empire that wanted to control both the northern and southern littorals needed to anchor its eastern flank on the Levant. For one thing, without the Levant, a Mediterranean power would be entirely dependent on sea lanes for controlling the other shore. Moving troops solely by sea creates transport limitations and logistical problems. It also leaves imperial lines vulnerable to interdiction — sometimes merely from pirates, a problem that plagued Rome's sea transport. A land bridge, or a land bridge with minimal water crossings that can be easily defended, is a vital supplement to the sea for the movement of large numbers of troops. Once the Hellespont is crossed, the coastal route through southern Turkey, down the Levant and along the Mediterranean's southern shore, provides such an alternative.  There is an additional consideration. If a Mediterranean empire leaves the Levant unoccupied, it opens the door to the possibility of a great power originating to the east seizing the ports of the Levant and challenging the Mediterranean power for maritime domination. In short, control of the Levant binds a Mediterranean empire together while denying a challenger from the east the opportunity to enter the Mediterranean. Holding the Levant, and controlling Israel, is a necessary preventive measure for a Mediterranean empire.  Israel is also important to any empire originating to the east of Israel, either in the Tigris-Euphrates basin or in Persia. For either, security could be assured only once it had an anchor on the Levant. Macedonian expansion under Alexander demonstrated that a power controlling Levantine and Turkish ports could support aggressive operations far to the east, to the Hindu Kush and beyond. While Turkish ports might have sufficed for offensive operations, simply securing the Bosporus still left the southern flank exposed. Therefore, by holding the Levant, an eastern power protected itself against attacks from Mediterranean powers.  The Levant was also important to any empire originating to the north or south of Israel. If Egypt decided to move beyond the Nile Basin and North Africa eastward, it would move first through the Sinai and then northward along the coastal plain, securing sea lanes to Egypt. When Asia Minor powers such as the Ottoman Empire developed, there was a natural tendency to move southward to control the eastern Mediterranean. The Levant is the crossroads of continents, and Israel lies in the path of many imperial ambitions.  Israel therefore occupies what might be called the convergence zone of the Eastern Hemisphere. A European power trying to dominate the Mediterranean or expand eastward, an eastern power trying to dominate the space between the Hindu Kush and the Mediterranean, a North African power moving toward the east, or a northern power moving south — all must converge on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean and therefore on Israel. Of these, the European power and the eastern power must be the most concerned with Israel. For either, there is no choice but to secure it as an anchor. Internal Geopolitics  Israel is geographically divided into three regions, which traditionally have produced three different types of people. Its coastal plain facilitates commerce, serving as the interface between eastern trade routes and the sea. It is the home of merchants and manufacturers, cosmopolitans — not as cosmopolitan as Phoenicia or Lebanon, but cosmopolitan for Israel. The northeast is hill country, closest to the unruliness north of the Litani River and to the Syrian threat. It breeds farmers and warriors. The area south of Jerusalem is hard desert country, more conducive to herdsman and warriors than anything else. Jerusalem is where these three regions are balanced and governed.  There are obviously deep differences built into Israel's geography and inhabitants, particularly between the herdsmen of the southern deserts and the northern hill dwellers. The coastal dwellers, rich but less warlike than the others, hold the balance or are the prize to be pursued. In the division of the original kingdom between Israel and Judea, we saw the alliance of the coast with the Galilee, while Jerusalem was held by the desert dwellers. The consequence of the division was that Israel in the north ultimately was conquered by Assyrians from the northeast, while Babylon was able to swallow Judea.  Social divisions in Israel obviously do not have to follow geographical lines. However, over time, these divisions must manifest themselves. For example, the coastal plain is inherently more cosmopolitan than the rest of the country. The interests of its inhabitants lie more with trading partners in the Mediterranean and the rest of the world than with their countrymen. Their standard of living is higher, and their commitment to traditions is lower. Therefore, there is an inherent tension between their immediate interests and those of the Galileans, who live more precarious, warlike lives. Countries can be divided over lesser issues — and when Israel is divided, it is vulnerable even to regional threats.  We say \"even\" because geography dictates that regional threats are less menacing than might be expected. The fact that Israel would be outnumbered demographically should all its neighbors turn on it is less important than the fact that it has adequate buffers in most directions, that the ability of neighbors to coordinate an attack is minimal and that their appetite for such an attack is even less. The single threat that Israel faces from the northeast can readily be managed if the Israelis create a united front there. When Israel was overrun by a Damascus-based power, it was deeply divided internally.  It is important to add one consideration to our discussion of buffers, which is diplomacy. The main neighbors of Israel are Egyptians, Syrians and those who live on the east bank of Jordan. This last group is a negligible force demographically, and the interests of the Syrians and Egyptians are widely divergent. Egypt's interests are to the south and west of its territory; the Sinai holds no attraction. Syria is always threatened from multiple directions, and alliance with Egypt adds little to its security. Therefore, under the worst of circumstances, Egypt and Syria have difficulty supporting each other. Under the best of circumstances, from Israel's point of view, it can reach a political accommodation with Egypt, securing its southwestern frontier politically as well as by geography, thus freeing Israel to concentrate on the northern threats and opportunities. Israel and the Great Powers  The threat to Israel rarely comes from the region, except when the Israelis are divided internally. The conquests of Israel occur when powers not adjacent to it begin forming empires. Babylon, Persia, Macedonia, Rome, Turkey and Britain all controlled Israel politically, sometimes for worse and sometimes for better. Each dominated it militarily, but none was a neighbor of Israel. This is a consistent pattern. Israel can resist its neighbors; danger arises when more distant powers begin playing imperial games. Empires can bring force to bear that Israel cannot resist.  Israel therefore has this problem: It would be secure if it could confine itself to protecting its interests from neighbors, but it cannot confine itself because its geographic location invariably draws larger, more distant powers toward Israel. Therefore, while Israel's military can focus only on immediate interests, its diplomatic interests must look much further. Israel is constantly entangled with global interests (as the globe is defined at any point), seeking to deflect and align with broader global powers. When it fails in this diplomacy, the consequences can be catastrophic.  Israel exists in three conditions. First, it can be a completely independent state. This condition occurs when there are no major imperial powers external to the region. We might call this the David model. Second, it can live as part of an imperial system — either as a subordinate ally, as a moderately autonomous entity or as a satrapy. In any case, it maintains its identity but loses room for independent maneuvering in foreign policy and potentially in domestic policy. We might call this the Persian model in its most beneficent form. Finally, Israel can be completely crushed — with mass deportations and migrations, with a complete loss of autonomy and minimal residual autonomy. We might call this the Babylonian model.  The Davidic model exists primarily when there is no external imperial power needing control of the Levant that is in a position either to send direct force or to support surrogates in the immediate region. The Persian model exists when Israel aligns itself with the foreign policy interests of such an imperial power, to its own benefit. The Babylonian model exists when Israel miscalculates on the broader balance of power and attempts to resist an emerging hegemon. When we look at Israeli behavior over time, the periods when Israel does not confront hegemonic powers outside the region are not rare, but are far less common than when it is confronting them.  Given the period of the first iteration of Israel, it would be too much to say that the Davidic model rarely comes into play, but certainly since that time, variations of the Persian and Babylonian models have dominated. The reason is geographic. Israel is normally of interest to outside powers because of its strategic position. While Israel can deal with local challenges effectively, it cannot deal with broader challenges. It lacks the economic or military weight to resist. Therefore, it is normally in the process of managing broader threats or collapsing because of them.  The Geopolitics of Contemporary Israel Let us then turn to the contemporary manifestation of Israel. Israel was recreated because of the interaction between a regional great power, the Ottoman Empire, and a global power, Great Britain. During its expansionary phase, the Ottoman Empire sought to dominate the eastern Mediterranean as well as both its northern and southern coasts. One thrust went through the Balkans toward central Europe. The other was toward Egypt. Inevitably, this required that the Ottomans secure the Levant.  For the British, the focus on the eastern Mediterranean was as the primary sea lane to India. As such, Gibraltar and the Suez were crucial. The importance of the Suez was such that the presence of a hostile, major naval force in the eastern Mediterranean represented a direct threat to British interests. It followed that defeating the Ottoman Empire during World War I and breaking its residual naval power was critical. The British, as was shown at Gallipoli, lacked the resources to break the Ottoman Empire by main force. They resorted to a series of alliances with local forces to undermine the Ottomans. One was an alliance with Bedouin tribes in the Arabian Peninsula; others involved covert agreements with anti-Turkish, Arab interests from the Levant to the Persian Gulf. A third, minor thrust was aligning with Jewish interests globally, particularly those interested in the refounding of Israel. Britain had little interest in this goal, but saw such discussions as part of the process of destabilizing the Ottomans.  The strategy worked. Under an agreement with France, the Ottoman province of Syria was divided into two parts on a line roughly running east-west between the sea and Mount Hermon. The northern part was given to France and divided into Lebanon and a rump Syria entity. The southern part was given to Britain and was called Palestine, after the Ottoman administrative district Filistina. Given the complex politics of the Arabian Peninsula, the British had to find a home for a group of Hashemites, which they located on the east bank of the Jordan River and designated, for want of a better name, the Trans-Jordan — the other side of the Jordan. Palestine looked very much like traditional Israel.  The ideological foundations of Zionism are not our concern here, nor are the pre- and post-World War II migrations of Jews, although those are certainly critical. What is important for purposes of this analysis are two things: First, the British emerged economically and militarily crippled from World War II and unable to retain their global empire, Palestine included. Second, the two global powers that emerged after World War II — the United States and the Soviet Union — were engaged in an intense struggle for the eastern Mediterranean after World War II, as can be seen in the Greek and Turkish issues at that time. Neither wanted to see the British Empire survive, each wanted the Levant, and neither was prepared to make a decisive move to take it.  Both the United States and the Soviet Union saw the re-creation of Israel as an opportunity to introduce their power to the Levant. The Soviets thought they might have some influence over Israel due to ideology. The Americans thought they might have some influence given the role of American Jews in the founding. Neither was thinking particularly clearly about the matter, because neither had truly found its balance after World War II. Both knew the Levant was important, but neither saw the Levant as a central battleground at that moment. Israel slipped through the cracks.  Once the question of Jewish unity was settled through ruthless action by David Ben Gurion's government, Israel faced a simultaneous threat from all of its immediate neighbors. However, as we have seen, the threat in 1948 was more apparent than real. The northern Levant, Lebanon, was fundamentally disunited — far more interested in regional maritime trade and concerned about control from Damascus. It posed no real threat to Israel. Jordan, settling the eastern bank of the Jordan River, was an outside power that had been transplanted into the region and was more concerned about native Arabs — the Palestinians — than about Israel. The Jordanians secretly collaborated with Israel. Egypt did pose a threat, but its ability to maintain lines of supply across the Sinai was severely limited and its genuine interest in engaging and destroying Israel was more rhetorical than real. As usual, the Egyptians could not afford the level of effort needed to move into the Levant. Syria by itself had a very real interest in Israel's defeat, but by itself was incapable of decisive action.  The exterior lines of Israel's neighbors prevented effective, concerted action. Israel's interior lines permitted efficient deployment and redeployment of force. It was not obvious at the time, but in retrospect we can see that once Israel existed, was united and had even limited military force, its survival was guaranteed. That is, so long as no great power was opposed to its existence.  From its founding until the Camp David Accords re-established the Sinai as a buffer with Egypt, Israel's strategic problem was this: So long as Egypt was in the Sinai, Israel's national security requirements outstripped its military capabilities. It could not simultaneously field an army, maintain its civilian economy and produce all the weapons and supplies needed for war. Israel had to align itself with great powers who saw an opportunity to pursue other interests by arming Israel.  Israel's first patron was the Soviet Union — through Czechoslovakia — which supplied weapons before and after 1948 in the hopes of using Israel to gain a foothold in the eastern Mediterranean. Israel, aware of the risks of losing autonomy, also moved into a relationship with a declining great power that was fighting to retain its empire: France. Struggling to hold onto Algeria and in constant tension with Arabs, France saw Israel as a natural ally. And apart from the operation against Suez in 1956, Israel saw in France a patron that was not in a position to reduce Israeli autonomy. However, with the end of the Algerian war and the realignment of France in the Arab world, Israel became a liability to France and, after 1967, Israel lost French patronage.  Israel did not become a serious ally of the Americans until after 1967. Such an alliance was in the American interest. The United States had, as a strategic imperative, the goal of keeping the Soviet navy out of the Mediterranean or, at least, blocking its unfettered access. That meant that Turkey, controlling the Bosporus, had to be kept in the American bloc. Syria and Iraq shifted policies in the late 1950s and by the mid-1960s had been armed by the Soviets. This made Turkey's position precarious: If the Soviets pressed from the north while Syria and Iraq pressed from the south, the outcome would be uncertain, to say the least, and the global balance of power was at stake. The United States used Iran to divert Iraq's attention. Israel was equally useful in diverting Syria's attention. So long as Israel threatened Syria from the south, it could not divert its forces to the north. That helped secure Turkey at a relatively low cost in aid and risk. By aligning itself with the interests of a great power, Israel lost some of its room for maneuver: For example, in 1973, it was limited by the United States in what it could do to Egypt. But those limitations aside, it remained autonomous internally and generally free to pursue its strategic interests.  The end of hostilities with Egypt, guaranteed by the Sinai buffer zone, created a new era for Israel. Egypt was restored to its traditional position, Jordan was a marginal power on the east bank, Lebanon was in its normal, unstable mode, and only Syria was a threat. However, it was a threat that Israel could easily deal with. Syria by itself could not threaten the survival of Israel.  Following Camp David (an ironic name), Israel was in its Davidic model, in a somewhat modified sense. Its survival was not at stake. Its problems — the domination of a large, hostile population and managing events in the northern Levant — were subcritical (meaning that, though these were not easy tasks, they did not represent fundamental threats to national survival, so long as Israel retained national unity). When unified, Israel has never been threatened by its neighbors. Geography dictates against it. Israel's danger will come only if a great power seeks to dominate the Mediterranean Basin or to occupy the region between Afghanistan and the Mediterranean. In the short period since the fall of the Soviet Union, this has been impossible. There has been no great power with the appetite and the will for such an adventure. But 15 years is not even a generation, and Israel must measure its history in centuries.  It is the nature of the international system to seek balance. The primary reality of the world today is the overwhelming power of the United States. The United States makes few demands on Israel that matter. However, it is the nature of things that the United States threatens the interests of other great powers who, individually weak, will try to form coalitions against it. Inevitably, such coalitions will arise. That will be the next point of danger for Israel.  In the event of a global rivalry, the United States might place onerous requirements on Israel. Alternatively, great powers might move into the Jordan River valley or ally with Syria, move into Lebanon or ally with Israel. The historical attraction of the eastern shore of the Mediterranean would focus the attention of such a power and lead to attempts to assert control over the Mediterranean or create a secure Middle Eastern empire. In either event, or some of the others discussed, it would create a circumstance in which Israel might face a Babylonian catastrophe or be forced into some variation of a Persian or Roman subjugation.  Israel's danger is not a Palestinian rising. Palestinian agitation is an irritant that Israel can manage so long as it does not undermine Israeli unity. Whether it is managed by domination or by granting the Palestinians a vassal state matters little. Nor can Israel be threatened by its neighbors. Even a unified attack by Syria and Egypt would fail, for the reasons discussed. Israel's real threat, as can be seen in history, lies in the event of internal division and/or a great power, coveting Israel's geographical position, marshalling force that is beyond its capacity to resist. Even that can be managed if Israel has a patron whose interests involve denying the coast to another power.  Israel's reality is this. It is a small country, yet must manage threats arising far outside of its region. It can survive only if it maneuvers with great powers commanding enormously greater resources. Israel cannot match the resources and, therefore, it must be constantly clever. There are periods when it is relatively safe because of great power alignments, but its normal condition is one of global unease. No nation can be clever forever, and Israel's history shows that some form of subordination is inevitable. Indeed, it is to a very limited extent subordinate to the United States now.  For Israel, the retention of a Davidic independence is difficult. Israel's strategy must be to manage its subordination effectively by dealing with its patron cleverly, as it did with Persia. But cleverness is not a geopolitical concept. It is not permanent, and it is not assured.

As recently as May 6, Secretary of State Clinton was still talking about a “reform agenda” in Syria, as if Bashar al-Assad were a slightly misguided bureaucrat rather than the murderer of roughly 1,000 unarmed demonstrators. As for the president, though the White House has issued a couple of statements in his name, he has yet to say one word on camera about the bloodletting in Syria. This is not a small matter, for a tough statement attacking the regime’s repression and giving the demonstrators moral support would immediately circulate over the Internet. American sanctions against Syria, meanwhile, have not named Assad, and there has been no call for him to step down.\n\n\nWhy is the administration appearing to stick with Assad and refusing to call for his ouster? A key reason may be the hope that an Israeli-Syrian peace deal can be arranged. \n\n\nFrom the day it came to office, the Obama administration clearly wanted to win an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement. There has been no progress during its two years in office, mostly because the White House insisted on a 100 percent construction freeze in the West Bank settlements and Jerusalem as a precondition for negotiations. This was politically impossible in Israel, and also meant that Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas could not come to the table lest he appear to be asking less from Israel than the Americans.\n\n\nWith negotiations frozen, the Palestinians turned to unilateral measures: seeking a United Nations vote admitting the State of Palestine to membership and getting dozens of countries to recognize a Palestinian state. Meanwhile, their delegitimization campaign against Israel continued apace, especially in Europe, where calls for boycotts and sanctions spread. On the pro-Israel side there was also consideration of unilateral measures—steps to head off the Palestinians diplomatically (several of which I described and supported in the April 11 Weekly Standard).\n\n\nSome forlorn hope may still have existed inside the administration that a compromise on construction could bring the Palestinians back to the table with the government of Israel—until the agreement between Hamas and Fatah was signed on April 27. This agreement, unless and until it collapses, makes Israeli concessions or new flexibility in the West Bank impossible and puts paid to the entire “peace process.” It brings Hamas into the Palestinian Authority government, ending a period of several years when Palestinian Security Forces have cooperated with the Israel Defense Forces against terrorism and against Hamas in particular. It will also bring Hamas—next year and for the first time—into the PLO, the body charged with negotiating peace with Israel. Even Yasser Arafat resisted that development when he headed the PLO, and it seems obvious that Israel cannot negotiate peace with an anti-Semitic terrorist group bent on its destruction.\n\n\nSo where can the White House turn if it wants some kind of peace process in the Middle East? Syria. After all, in his first term as prime minister, back in 1998, Benjamin Netanyahu did authorize indirect negotiations with Syria. And the IDF—and especially Ehud Barak, a former head of the IDF, Israel’s defense minister, and a close adviser to Netanyahu—has long favored such a deal. The IDF theory was that if Syria made peace, so would Lebanon, and then Israel would be at peace with all four neighboring Arab states. And it can be argued now that Assad may see negotiations with Israel as a way to climb back from the pariah status he is earning, making him at this juncture truly open to a new peace process.\n\n\nSuch thinking, whether in Jerusalem or the White House, is foolish and even grotesque. There is no possibility that Assad would negotiate seriously and that an agreement could be attained. He is now clinging desperately to power, and his only true allies are Iran and Hezbollah. Yet Israel’s (and, one hopes, our own) key precondition to any agreement would necessarily be a clean break in those relationships: an end to the Syrian alliance with Hezbollah and Iran. Otherwise Israel would be giving the Golan, in effect, to Iran—a suicidal act. No Israeli government would do it, which suggests that negotiations with Assad would have no purpose.\n\n\nAssad may indeed be open to commencing a negotiation as a means to escape international isolation, but that’s all the more reason not to give it to him. Prime Minister Ehud Olmert’s 2008 talks with Syria (via Turkey) allowed Syria to escape the partial isolation the United States had imposed on it in that decade, with zero gain for Israel. This is not an experiment worth repeating, for the Assad regime is today even more despicable than it was three years ago.\n\n\nTo react to the murders now taking place all over Syria by embracing the Assad regime would be morally indefensible. Whether Assad can be overthrown soon by the people of Syria is a fair question to ask. Will the army stay with him, or will Sunni units rebel? Will the Sunni business elites turn against him? How long can the regime survive? We do not yet know the answers. But surely we must avoid any step that could help Assad, rehabilitate his regime, or undermine the courageous struggle of peaceful demonstrators in the streets of Syria. \n\n\nThe peace agreements that Israel signed with Egypt and Jordan were real achievements, but there will be no such agreements with the Palestinians or with Syria in the foreseeable future. The Palestinians have taken themselves out of the game for now. We cannot turn from them to the Syrians while Assad’s troops are using howitzers and sniper rifles against his people. This is the time not for diplomatic engagement with Assad, but for diplomacy aimed at quarantining his regime and helping bring it down. The White House should dismiss any remaining dreams of a “peace process” with Syria to substitute for the Palestinian version and face facts: There will be no peace with the butcher who rules Syria today. \n\n\n\n\n\nElliott Abrams, senior fellow for Middle Eastern studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, was a deputy national security adviser in the George W. Bush administration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\fArticle 2.\n\n\nThe Daily Star\n\n\nA democratic Arab world would welcome peace with Israel\nHamid Alkifaey\n\nOne could reasonably argue that the golden opportunity for peace in the Middle East was blown away when Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated on Nov. 4, 1995. \nHe was the only Israeli leader capable of making peace with the Palestinians, and was about to do so had it not been for the bullets of Yigal Amir, the right-wing religious zealot who believed in the “winner takes all” principle. \nOne could also claim that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and its global ramifications are responsible for agitating religious extremism in the Muslim world as a whole, and among Palestinians in particular. Prior to 1987, there was hardly any Islamic factor in Palestinian resistance. The Hamas and Islamic Jihad groups were established after the 1987 intifada. From this we deduce that extremism on the Israeli side led to the same on the Palestinian side, and consequently in other Muslim countries, which manifests in popular opposition to traditional and despotic regimes.\nThe Arab world is currently going through a social and political revolution that has so far claimed two “entrenched” regimes in Tunisia and Egypt. At least three other regimes in the region are fighting for their lives, and are not expected to survive. There will soon be different styles of government in Libya, Yemen and Syria. This much is certain. \nWill there be a different policy toward Israel? Certainly. But this will take time to take shape, since there are more pressing national priorities, such as political and economic reforms. Israel has long branded the Arab world as tribal and undemocratic, in order to brand itself the only democracy in the Middle East. Well, soon enough it won’t be. Many of its neighbors will soon join the democratic world as demands for democracy grow. Democracy will mean more development, prosperity and people’s power. It means more popular participation in decision making and awareness of the possibilities of the nation and what it can and cannot do. It may not mean more hostility toward Israel if the latter knows how to deal with it. But there will be tension if Israel continues to follow extreme policies, which it will under the current leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu. \nThe Palestinians must achieve their right to establish their own state on their land. This right has been recognized by almost everyone except a minority of extremists in Israel, led by Netanyahu. Free and democratic Arab countries won’t shrink from supporting this Palestinian right under any circumstances. Muslims will not give up on East Jerusalem, either. Arab regimes have been weak in the past. Democracy will strengthen them, but also add reason to Arab governance. Most Arabs have accepted Israel’s right to exist, and accepted U.N. resolutions 242 and 338, but Israeli intransigence is not helping them formulate a unified position. \nDemocratic Egypt won’t be a threat to Israel as the Egyptian military, which will continue to be highly influential in Egypt’s politics in the foreseeable future, will not risk another war with Israel. Egyptians under a democratic regime will be seeking better living standards, better laws to govern the country and more rights as citizens. They won’t be pressing their government to fight Israel; on the contrary, they want a stable economy where things will be better for future generations. But Israel may aggravate the situation by electing extremists and following extreme policies. This will strengthen the hands of the hawks in the Arab world. Moderate Israel under reasonable and realistic leaders should have nothing to fear from Egypt, with which it has an enduring peace treaty. \nThe situation with Syria may not be exactly the same, however, especially when the two countries are still officially in a state of war. The regime of Bashar Assad, and his father before him, would have never started a war with Israel unilaterally. It also suited them not to have a peace treaty. Any new Syrian leader is not likely (for a considerable period of time) to initiate a move toward a peace agreement with Israel as this will weaken his position domestically. Nor will he launch a war, however, since such a war will not result in victory. A democratic regime in Syria, or any other Arab country for that matter, will need a good 10 years to build democratic institutions and stabilize a modern market economy needed in any democracy. So, war won’t be on the agenda in the near future.\nProsperity increases the public’s stake in a stable economy, and this will make people want to compromise to make their country more prosperous and stable. However, everything will depend on how prepared the free world is to help new democracies in the Middle East survive and prosper. Small Islamic groups, organized and armed with religious zeal, could hijack power from the moderates. This would lead to a disaster for the whole region. Therefore, it is imperative for the free world, Israel included, not to leave matters to chance. A proactive stance is needed to nurture democracy and help moderate forces organize themselves in order to govern the region\n\nHamid Alkifaey is a writer and journalist.

With the new president standing beside Mitchell and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Vice President Joe Biden took the podium and extolled Mitchell's reputation and experience having brokered peace in Northern Ireland, calling him an \"outstanding public servant\" with \"incredible capacity.\" In the press, Mitchell was praised as the right man for the job at the right time.\n\n\nOn Friday, though, that capacity had reached its limit, and Mitchell told his bosses in the West Wing that he'd had enough. His reasons, he said, were personal—the kind of nebulous rationale that leaves ample room for interpretation. Unmentioned were the months of frustration that Mitchell had built up as direct negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians became more difficult and the peace process further off.\n\n\nThe timing of Mitchell's departure couldn't be more awkward. Obama will meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Jordan's King Abdullah next week, as well as deliver a major speech on Middle East policy. But the resignation didn't come as a surprise to those who worked closest with Mitchell. A State Department official described to Newsweek a man increasingly annoyed by both parties' constant moving of the goal posts and the constraints of the administration's unshakeable political instinct to support Israel.\n\n\nThe strain was noticeable in the Middle East. In a recent interview with Newsweek, one senior Israeli official said Mitchell often would say one thing about the direction the U.S. was taking with the two sides, only to be contradicted by Dennis Ross, Clinton's special adviser to the region. The official, who did not want to be quoted by name, said it seemed as if Mitchell had abdicated his role completely in recent months. Indeed, Mitchell's frequent visits to Israel and the West Bank slowed to a trickle; his last visit to the region was in December.\n\n\nWhen he was there, officials on both sides of the conflict had voiced bewilderment at Mitchell's hands-off approach to the complex negotiating process. With a small staff in Israel, he would shuttle between Jerusalem and Ramallah to meet with senior advisers to the leaders of both sides and then leave after just a few days. In an interview with Newsweek last month, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas openly accused Mitchell of not doing his job. \"Every visit by Mitchell, we talked to him and gave him some ideas,\" he said. \"At the end we discovered that he didn't convey any of these ideas to the Israelis. What does it mean?\"\n\n\nA politically attuned man who was once Senate Majority Leader, Mitchell was aware of the complaints about him. His usual comeback was to point to his success in Northern Ireland, which earned him the Presidential Medal of Freedom. For hundreds of days, he liked to say, he was considered a failure, until the final day, when he actually got it done.\n\n\nMitchell's resignation letter set off a small panic inside the West Wing earlier in the week. Senior advisers, as well as Obama himself, could sense the increasing difficulty of the job: Administration officials had been unable to convince Israel to halve new settlements in the West Bank, alienating Palestinians, and Israelis were irked in early May when Abbas allied with Hamas, a group that refuses to denounce violence against Israel. But the symbolism of Mitchell leaving several days before Obama's biggest week of outreach to the region projected a vacuum of confidence that anything hopeful, however remote, was on the horizon.\n\n\n\"He wouldn't be leaving at this important hour if he knew there was going to be a significant change in the administration's attitude toward the peace process,\" said Middle East analyst Gregory Orfalea, who formerly taught at Georgetown's School of Foreign Service. \"He's leaving because it's status quo.\"\n\n\nMitchell will be replaced—in the interim by his deputy, David Hale—and another official will take a crack at the quandary. But despite new momentum from Netanyahu's visit next week and Obama's speech Thursday, Mitchell's departure could signal stagnant talks for the next several years. According to Fawaz Gerges, director of the London School of Economics' Middle East Center, \"the reality is that, with Mitchell leaving, Barack Obama basically lost the ideological battle [over how to confront the peace process]. By now he'll have to wait for the second term before you can get another concerted effort.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDaniel Stone is Newsweek's White House correspondent.

Despite significant pressure from the Obama administration to remain on the sidelines, Saudi leaders sent troops into Manama in March to defend Bahrain’s monarchy and quell the unrest that has shaken that country since February. For more than 60 years, Saudi Arabia has been bound by an unwritten bargain: oil for security. Riyadh has often protested but ultimately acquiesced to what it saw as misguided U.S. policies. But American missteps in the region since Sept. 11, an ill-conceived response to the Arab protest movements and an unconscionable refusal to hold Israel accountable for its illegal settlement building have brought this arrangement to an end. As the Saudis recalibrate the partnership, Riyadh intends to pursue a much more assertive foreign policy, at times conflicting with American interests. The backdrop for this change are the rise of Iranian meddling in the region and the counterproductive policies that the United States has pursued here since Sept. 11. The most significant blunder may have been the invasion of Iraq, which resulted in enormous loss of life and provided Iran an opening to expand its sphere of influence. For years, Iran’s leadership has aimed to foment discord while furthering its geopolitical ambitions. Tehran has long funded Hamas and Hezbollah; recently, its scope of attempted interference has broadened to include the affairs of Arab states from Yemen to Morocco. This month the chief of staff of Iran’s armed forces, Gen. Hasan Firouzabadi, harshly criticized Riyadh over its intervention in Bahrain, claiming this act would spark massive domestic uprisings.\n\n\nSuch remarks are based more on wishful thinking than fact, but Iran’s efforts to destabilize its neighbors are tireless. As Riyadh fights a cold war with Tehran, Washington has shown itself in recent months to be an unwilling and unreliable partner against this threat. The emerging political reality is a Saudi-led Arab world facing off against the aggression of Iran and its non-state proxies. Saudi Arabia will not allow the political unrest in the region to destabilize the Arab monarchies — the Gulf states, Jordan and Morocco. In Yemen, the Saudis are insisting on an orderly transition of power and a dignified exit for President Ali Abdullah Saleh (a courtesy that was not extended to Hosni Mubarak, despite the former Egyptian president’s many years as a strong U.S. ally). To facilitate this handover, Riyadh is leading a diplomatic effort under the auspices of the six-country Gulf Cooperation Council. In Iraq, the Saudi government will continue to pursue a hard-line stance against the Maliki government, which it regards as little more than an Iranian puppet. In Lebanon, Saudi Arabia will act to check the growth of Hezbollah and to ensure that this Iranian proxy does not dominate the country’s political life. Regarding the widespread upheaval in Syria, the Saudis will work to ensure that any potential transition to a post-Assad era is as peaceful and as free of Iranian meddling as possible.  Regarding Israel, Riyadh is adamant that a just settlement, based on King Abdullah’s proposed peace plan, be implemented. This includes a Palestinian state with its capital in East Jerusalem. The United States has lost all credibility on this issue; after casting the sole vote in the U.N. Security Council against censuring Israel for its illegal settlement building, it can no longer act as an objective mediator. This act was a watershed in U.S.-Saudi relations, guaranteeing that Saudi leaders will not push for further compromise from the Palestinians, despite American pressure.\n\n\nSaudi Arabia remains strong and stable, lending muscle to its invigorated foreign policy. Spiritually, the kingdom plays a unique role for the world’s 1.2 billion Muslims — more than 1 billion of whom are Sunni — as the birthplace of Islam and home of the two holiest cities. Politically, its leaders enjoy broad domestic support, and a growing nationalism has knitted the historically tribal country more closely together. This is largely why widespread protests, much anticipated by Western media in March, never materialized. As the world’s sole energy superpower and the de facto central banker of the global energy markets, Riyadh is the economic powerhouse of the Middle East, representing 25 percent of the combined gross domestic product of the Arab world. The kingdom has amassed more than $550 billion in foreign reserves and is spending more than $150 billion to improve infrastructure, public education, social services and health care.  To counter the threats posed by Iran and transnational terrorist networks, the Saudi leadership is authorizing more than $100 billion of additional military spending to modernize ground forces, upgrade naval capabilities and more. The kingdom is doubling its number of high-quality combat aircraft and adding 60,000 security personnel to the Interior Ministry forces. Plans are underway to create a “Special Forces Command,” based on the U.S. model, to unify the kingdom’s various special forces if needed for rapid deployment abroad. Saudi Arabia has the will and the means to meet its expanded global responsibilities. In some issues, such as counterterrorism and efforts to fight money laundering, the Saudis will continue to be a strong U.S. partner. In areas in which Saudi national security or strategic interests are at stake, the kingdom will pursue its own agenda. With Iran working tirelessly to dominate the region, the Muslim Brotherhood rising in Egypt and unrest on nearly every border, there is simply too much at stake for the kingdom to rely on a security policy written in Washington, which has backfired more often than not and spread instability. The special relationship may never be the same, but from this transformation a more stable and secure Middle East can be born. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe writer is a senior fellow at the King Faisal Center for Research & Islamic Studies. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\fArticle 5.\n\n\nNewsweek\n\n\nDr. K’s Rx for China\n\n\nNiall Ferguson\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 15, 2011  -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton thinks the Chinese government is “scared” of the Arab Spring. “They’re worried,” she told Jeffrey Goldberg in the latest Atlantic, “and they are trying to stop history, which is a fool’s errand. They cannot do it.”\n\n\nThese are words—intemperate, undiplomatic, and very likely counterproductive—that you cannot imagine being uttered by her predecessor Henry Kissinger. It is now 40 years since Kissinger went on his secret mission to China, to pave the way for President Richard Nixon’s historic visit the following year. Since then he has visited the country more than 50 times. And if there is one thing he has learned, it is this: the real fool’s errand is to lean on the Chinese. Much has changed in the world since Kissinger’s first trip to China. (In 1971, who would have dared to predict that America’s public enemy No. 1 would be a Saudi-born Islamic fundamentalist skulking in a walled compound in Pakistan?) But at least two things in American foreign policy remain consistent: the relationship with mainland China, revived by Kissinger after more than 20 years in the deep freeze, and Kissinger himself, consulted formally or informally by every president from John F. Kennedy to Barack Obama. On China, Kissinger’s new book, is a reminder of why our leaders still want to pick his brains. Eighty-eight years old this month, he remains without equal as a strategic thinker.  The opening to China is a story Kissinger has told before: how he and Nixon had discerned that country could become a strategic counterweight to the Soviet Union; how he secretly flew to China after feigning illness in Pakistan; how he and Premier Zhou Enlai hammered out the diplomatic basis for Nixon’s official visit (the Shanghai Communiqué). The result was, as he puts it, “a quasi alliance,” which, though initially intended to contain the Soviet Union, ended up outliving the Cold War.\n\n\nIn this telling, however, Kissinger is able to take advantage of recent research that illuminates the Chinese side of the story. The American opening to China was also a Chinese opening to America, actuated above all by Mao Zedong’s fear of encirclement. “Think about this,” Mao told his doctor in 1969. “We have the Soviet Union to the north and the west, India to the south, and Japan to the east. If all our enemies were to unite, attacking us from the north, south, east, and west, what do you think we should do?” The medic had no idea. “Think again,” said Mao. “Beyond Japan is the United States. Didn’t our ancestors counsel negotiating with faraway countries while fighting with those that are near?” It was to explore the American option that Mao recalled four Army marshals from exile. Skirmishes were already underway between Soviet and Chinese forces on the Ussuri River. In October 1970 Mao ordered China’s top leadership to evacuate Beijing and put the People’s Liberation Army on “first-degree combat readiness.” The stakes for China were high indeed—higher than for the United States.  As Kissinger shows, it was far from unusual for Mao to refer to “our ancestors’ counsel.” Despite his lifelong commitment to Marxism-Leninism, Mao was also steeped in the classics of Chinese civilization, as were his close advisers. “We can consult the example of Zhuge Liang’s strategic guiding principle,” Marshal Ye Jian-ying suggested, “when the three states of Wei, Shu, and Wu confronted each other: ‘Ally with Wu in the east to oppose Wei in the north.’ ” The allusion, Kissinger explains, is to Romance of the Three Kingdoms, a 14th-century epic novel set in the so-called Warring States period (475–221 B.C.).\n\n\nNor was this the only occasion when China’s communist leaders looked to the distant past for inspiration. Of equal importance to them, Kissinger argues, was The Art of War by Sun Tzu, which dates from the even earlier Spring and Autumn period (770–476 B.C.). “The victorious army/Is victorious first/And seeks battle later”: axioms like this one encouraged Chinese strategists to think of international relations like the board game Weiqi (known in the West as Go), a “game of surrounding pieces.”   Mao shared with China’s prerevolutionary leaders an assumption that China is not like other countries. With a population that amounts to a fifth of humanity, it is Zhongguo: the Middle Kingdom or, perhaps more accurately, the “Central Country.” At times it could even seem like tian xia: “all under heaven.” The best foreign policy for such an empire was to “let barbarians fight barbarians.” If that failed, then the strongest of the barbarians should be embraced and civilized (as happened to the Manchus).   “Domineering and overwhelming … ruthless and aloof, poet and warrior, prophet and scourge”—Mao’s true hero was not Lenin but the tyrannical, book-burning “first emperor,” Qin Shi Huang, who united China in 221 B.C. In a similar way, Kissinger shows, the current generation of Chinese leaders have drawn inspiration from the teachings of Kong Fu Zi (known in the West as Confucius). Their goal, he argues, is not world domination but da tong: “great harmony.”   This goes to the heart of the matter. In 1971, when Kissinger first went to China, the U.S. economy was roughly five times that of the People’s Republic. Forty years later, as a result of the industrial revolution unleashed by Mao’s successor Deng Xiao-ping, it is conceivable that China could overtake America within a decade. This is a feat the Soviet Union never came close to achieving. Moreover, China is now the biggest foreign holder of U.S. Treasury notes, which form an important part of its vast $3 trillion of international reserves. How China will use its newfound economic power may be the most important question of our time. Few Americans are better placed to answer that question than Kissinger, who has dealt with four generations of Chinese leaders.\n\n\nThe most profound insights of On China are psychological. They concern the fundamental cultural differences between a Chinese elite who can look back more than two millennia for inspiration and an American elite whose historical frame of reference is little more than two centuries old. This became most obvious in the wake of June 1989, when Americans recoiled from the use of military force to end the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy demonstrations. To Kissinger’s eyes, it was doubly naive to retaliate to this crackdown with sanctions: “Western concepts of human rights and individual liberties may not be directly translatable … to a civilization for millennia ordered around different concepts. Nor can the traditional Chinese fear of political chaos be dismissed as an anachronistic irrelevancy needing only ‘correction’ by Western enlightenment.”\n\n\nAs China’s first Anglophone leader, Jiang Zemin, explained to Kissinger in 1991: “We never submit to pressure … It is a philosophical principle.”   The United States and China went to war in Korea because of another cultural gap. It came as a surprise to the Americans when Mao ordered Chinese intervention because the military odds looked so unfavorable. But, argues Kissinger, his “motivating force was less to inflict a decisive military first blow than to change the psychological balance, not so much to defeat the enemy as to alter his calculus of risks.” Mao was a master of the ancient Empty City Stratagem, which seeks to conceal weakness with a show of confidence, even aggression. To Westerners, his insistence that he did not fear a nuclear attack seemed unhinged or, at best, callous (“We may lose more than 300 million people. So what? War is war. The years will pass, and we’ll get to work producing more babies than ever before”). But this was classical Chinese bravado, or “offensive deterrence.”    “Chinese negotiators,” observes Kissinger in a passage that should be inwardly digested not just by American diplomats but also by American businessmen before they land in Beijing, “use diplomacy to weave together political, military, and psychological elements into an overall strategic design.” American diplomacy, by contrast, “generally prefers …c to be ‘flexible’; it feels an obligation to break deadlocks with new proposals—unintentionally inviting new deadlocks to elicit new proposals.” We could learn a thing or two from the Chinese, Kissinger implies, particularly Sun Tzu’s concept of shi, meaning the “potential energy” of the overall strategic landscape. Our tendency is to have an agenda of 10 different points, each one to be dealt with separately. They have one big game plan. We are always in a hurry for closure, anxiously watching the minutes tick away. The Chinese value patience; as Mao explained to Kissinger, they measure time in millennia.\n\n\nSuch fundamental cultural differences may give rise to conflict with China in the future, Kissinger warns: “When the Chinese view of preemption encounters the Western concept of deterrence, a vicious circle can result: acts conceived as defensive in China may be treated as aggressive by the outside world; deterrent moves by the West may be interpreted in China as encirclement. The United States and China wrestled with this dilemma repeatedly during the Cold War; to some extent they have not yet found a way to transcend it.”\n\n\nCould the United States and the People’s Republic come to blows again? The possibility cannot be excluded. As Kissinger reminds us, war was the result when Germany rose to challenge Britain economically and geopolitically 100 years ago. Moreover, the key factor that brought America and China together in the 1970s—the common Soviet enemy the Chinese called “the polar bear”—has vanished from the scene. Old, intractable differences persist over Taiwan and North Korea. What remains is “Chimerica,” a less-than-happy marriage of economic convenience in which one partner does all the saving and the other does all the spending.\n\n\nIn Kissinger’s own words, China’s rise could “make international relations bipolar again,” ushering in a new cold (or possibly even hot) war. Nationalist writers like Liu Mingfu, author of China Dream, urge China to switch from “peaceful development” to “military rise” and look forward to the “duel of the century” with the United States. There are those in Washington, too—apparently including, for the moment, the Obama administration—who would relish a more confrontational relationship.   Yet Kissinger remains hopeful that cooler heads will prevail in Beijing: thinkers like Zheng Bijian, who urges China to “transcend the traditional ways for great powers to emerge” and “not [to] follow the path of Germany leading up to World War I.” Rather than attempting to “organize Asia on the basis of containing China or creating a bloc of democratic states for an ideological crusade,” the United States would do better, Kissinger suggests, to work with China to build a new “Pacific Community.”\n\n\nFour decades ago, Richard Nixon grasped sooner than most the huge potential of China. “Well,” he mused, “you can just stop and think of what could happen if anybody with a decent system of government got control of that mainland. Good God … There’d be no power in the world that could even—I mean, you put 800 million Chinese to work under a decent system … and they will be the leaders of the world.” That prophecy is being fulfilled in our time. The fact that until now China’s rise has been a boon to the United States rather than a bane owes much to the work of Henry Kissinger. With this book he has given his successors an indispensable guide to continuing the Sino-American “coevolution” he began.\n\n\n\n\n\nFerguson is writing a biography of Henry Kissinger.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\fArticle 6.\n\n\nHurriyet Daily News\n\n\nSyria as Turkey’s domestic issue\n\n\nYusuf Kanli\n\nMay 15, 2011 -- Syria is no Libya for many reasons; not just because it is a country right on the Turkish border or, like Turkey, it has a Kurdish population and an explosion there may ignite an explosion on this side of the border as well.\n\n\nLike a broken watch that shows correct time twice a day, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan as well occasionally makes some correct analysis. Last week, while comparing the uprising in Libya against the Moammar Gadhafi regime and the growing unrest in the Syrian street against the Baathist regime of Bashar al-Assad, the prime minister correctly said Libya and Syria were two totally different issues for Turkey.\n\n\nErdoğan explained while Turkey was very much concerned with what’s happening in Libya and have been undertaking every possible effort to contribute to a quick end to the tumult and restoration of peace and order in Libya, Syria was very much like a domestic incident for Turkey.\n\n\nAs part of its neo-Ottoman drive to enhance its influence in the Middle Eastern territory of the former Ottoman Empire the ruling Justice and development Party, or AKP, government of Turkey has long waived visa requirement in travel between Turkey and Syria. The aim behind that move was to plant the seeds of a future European Union-like Middle Eastern union led by Turkey but the first tangible result was not a marked increase in commercial, business or tourist interactions, but a batch of 250 refugees running from the fire on the Syrian street.\n\n\nIf the problem continues and escalates further in the Syrian street it is probable that the prefabricated facility in the Hatay province constructed to provide temporary lodging to pilgrims during the Hajj season will not suffice in providing a shelter to Syrian refugees who thanks to the no-visa regime in travel between Turkey and Syria may freely escape to Turkey from the trouble in their own street and thus carry the problem to the Turkish street.\n\n\nFor now the separatist Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, terrorists are abiding with an unilateral truce, which is claimed to have been negotiated with the government by Abdullah Öcalan, the chieftain of the gang serving an enforced life term on the İmralı island prison, which according to claims will last until June 15, three days after the June 12 parliamentary elections. Indeed, excluding some rehearsal for a possible mass civilian disobedience campaign after the elections and some exceptional terrorist acts, it might be said that there is nothing extraordinary in Turkey’s southeast bordering Syria, Iraq and Iran, where there are sizeable Kurdish populations.\n\n\nThe “success” of the unrest in Syrian streets in uprooting the government might mean added trouble for Turkey, which has been battling with separatist terrorism for the past 25 years. Turkey remaining silent or supportive of the Assad regime crushing the pressure for a regime change and reform calls of the Syrian street, on the other hand, would seriously imperil the regional role aspired by the AKP governance of Turkey.\n\n\nIndeed, while the AKP government in Ankara joined the calls of the U.S.-led coalition of the willing that time is up for Moammar Gadhafi in Libya and for peace and safety of his own people Gadhafi must step down, as regards to Syria Ankara, as well as the Western alliance, has been restraining their calls with a shy request from Assad to accelerate reforms.\n\n\nWhile Ankara may answer anti-Turkish demonstrations in Libya by closing down the Turkish embassy in Tripoli, the first ever such action by the diplomatic service throughout its modern history, anti-Turkish demonstrations in Damascus can be really costly for Turkey now and in the future.\n\n\nWhile the personal friendly relations between Assad and his counterpart in Turkey, Erdoğan, might provide Turkey a golden opportunity to help Syria sail out of the current tumultuous situation. Of course at a time when Erdoğan himself is after converting Turkey into his sultanate of fear under the aegis of advanced democracy it might be absurd to expect him to advise Assad of a democratic way out of the mess in Syria. Yet, as much as Turkey needs to see restoration of peace, security and stability in Syria for domestic security reasons as well as for its regional role, Syria and President Assad need Turkey and Erdoğan to walk the extra mile in reforms advised by them, as the real-politic of the day compels him to do so if he wants to sail out of this problem in one piece.\n\n\nIf, however, despite Turkey’s democracy and reform preaches, the massacres continue in the Syrian street not only the prestige of Erdoğan in the Arab street will be seriously impaired but sooner or later the fire in the Arab street will have a reflection on the Turkish streets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\fArticle 7.\n\n\nSTRATFOR\n\n\nThe Geopolitics of Israel: Biblical and Modern \n\n\n\n\n\nThe founding principle of geopolitics is that place — geography — plays a significant role in determining how nations will behave. If that theory is true, then there ought to be a deep continuity in a nation's foreign policy. Israel is a laboratory for this theory, since it has existed in three different manifestations in roughly the same place, twice in antiquity and once in modernity. If geopolitics is correct, then Israeli foreign policy, independent of policymakers, technology or the identity of neighbors, ought to have important common features. This is, therefore, a discussion of common principles in Israeli foreign policy over nearly 3,000 years. \nFor convenience, we will use the term \"Israel\" to connote all of the Hebrew and Jewish entities that have existed in the Levant since the invasion of the region as chronicled in the Book of Joshua. As always, geopolitics requires a consideration of three dimensions: the internal geopolitics of Israel, the interaction of Israel and the immediate neighbors who share borders with it, and Israel's interaction with what we will call great powers, beyond Israel's borderlands. \nIsrael has manifested itself three times in history. The first manifestation began with the invasion led by Joshua and lasted through its division into two kingdoms, the Babylonian conquest of the Kingdom of Judah and the deportation to Babylon early in the sixth century B.C. The second manifestation began when Israel was recreated in 540 B.C. by the Persians, who had defeated the Babylonians. The nature of this second manifestation changed in the fourth century B.C., when Greece overran the Persian Empire and Israel, and again in the first century B.C., when the Romans conquered the region. \nThe second manifestation saw Israel as a small actor within the framework of larger imperial powers, a situation that lasted until the destruction of the Jewish vassal state by the Romans. \nIsrael's third manifestation began in 1948, following (as in the other cases) an ingathering of t least some of the Jews who had been dispersed after conquests. Israel's founding takes place in the context of the decline and fall of the British Empire and must, at least in part, be understood as part of British imperial history. \nDuring its first 50 years, Israel plays a pivotal role in the confrontation of the United States and the Soviet Union and, in some senses, is hostage to the dynamics of these two countries. In other words, like the first two manifestations of Israel, the third finds Israel continually struggling among independence, internal tension and imperial ambition.\nIsraeli Geography and Borderlands \nAt its height, under King David, Israel extended from the Sinai to the Euphrates, encompassing Damascus. It occupied some, but relatively little, of the coastal region, an area beginning at what today is Haifa and running south to Jaffa, just north of today's Tel Aviv. The coastal area to the north was held by Phoenicia, the area to the south by Philistines. It is essential to understand that Israel's size and shape shifted over time. For example, Judah under the Hasmoneans did not include the Negev but did include the Golan. The general locale of Israel is fixed. Its precise borders have never been.\nThus, it is perhaps better to begin with what never was part of Israel. Israel never included the Sinai Peninsula. Along the coast, it never stretched much farther north than the Litani River in today's Lebanon. Apart from David's extreme extension (and fairly tenuous control) to the north, Israel's territory never stretched as far as Damascus, although it frequently held the Golan Heights. Israel extended many times to both sides of the Jordan but never deep into the Jordanian Desert. It never extended southeast into the Arabian Peninsula. \nIsrael consists generally of three parts. First, it always has had the northern hill region, stretching from the foothills of Mount Hermon south to Jerusalem. Second, it always contains some of the coastal plain from today's Tel Aviv north to Haifa. Third, it occupies area between Jerusalem and the Jordan River — today's West Bank. At times, it controls all or part of the Negev, including the coastal region between the Sinai to the Tel Aviv area. It may be larger than this at various times in history, and sometimes smaller, but it normally holds all or part of these three regions. \nIsrael is well-buffered in three directions. The Sinai Desert protects it against the Egyptians. In general, the Sinai has held little attraction for the Egyptians. The difficulty of deploying forces in the eastern Sinai poses severe logistical problems for them, particularly during a prolonged presence. Unless Egypt can rapidly move through the Sinai north into the coastal plain, where it can sustain its forces more readily, deploying in the Sinai is difficult and unrewarding. Therefore, so long as Israel is not so weak as to make an attack on the coastal plain a viable option, or unless Egypt is motivated by an outside imperial power, Israel does not face a threat from the southwest. \nIsrael is similarly protected from the southeast. The deserts southeast of Eilat-Aqaba are virtually impassable. No large force could approach from that direction, although smaller raiding parties could. The tribes of the Arabian Peninsula lack the reach or the size to pose a threat to Israel, unless massed and aligned with other forces. Even then, the approach from the southeast is not one that they are likely to take. The Negev is secure from that direction. \nThe eastern approaches are similarly secured by desert, which begins about 20 to 30 miles east of the Jordan River. While indigenous forces exist in the borderland east of the Jordan, they lack the numbers to be able to penetrate decisively west of the Jordan. Indeed, the normal model is that, so long as Israel controls Judea and Samaria (the modern-day West Bank), then the East Bank of the Jordan River is under the political and sometimes military domination of Israel — sometimes directly through settlement, sometimes indirectly through political influence, or economic or security leverage. \nIsrael's vulnerability is in the north. There is no natural buffer between Phoenicia and its successor entities (today's Lebanon) to the direct north. The best defense line for Israel in the north is the Litani River, but this is not an insurmountable boundary under any circumstance. However, the area along the coast north of Israel does not present a serious threat. The coastal area prospers through trade in the Mediterranean basin. It is oriented toward the sea and to the trade routes to the east, not to the south. If it does anything, this area protects those trade routes and has no appetite for a conflict that might disrupt trade. It stays out of Israel's way, for the most part. \nMoreover, as a commercial area, this region is generally wealthy, a factor that increases predators around it and social conflict within. It is an area prone to instability. Israel frequently tries to extend its influence northward for commercial reasons, as one of the predators, and this can entangle Israel in its regional politics. But barring this self-induced problem, the threat to Israel from the north is minimal, despite the absence of natural boundaries and the large population. On occasion, there is spillover of conflicts from the north, but not to a degree that might threaten regime survival in Israel. \nThe neighbor that is always a threat lies to the northeast. Syria — or, more precisely, the area governed by Damascus at any time — is populous and frequently has no direct outlet to the sea. It is, therefore, generally poor. The area to its north, Asia Minor, is heavily mountainous. Syria cannot project power to the north except with great difficulty, but powers in Asia Minor can move south. Syria's eastern flank is buffered by a desert that stretches to the Euphrates. Therefore, when there is no threat from the north, Syria's interest — after securing itself internally — is to gain access to the coast. Its primary channel is directly westward, toward the rich cities of the northern Levantine coast, with which it trades heavily. An alternative interest is southwestward, toward the southern Levantine coast controlled by Israel. \nAs can be seen, Syria can be interested in Israel only selectively. When it is interested, it has a serious battle problem. To attack Israel, it would have to strike between Mount Hermon and the Sea of Galilee, an area about 25 miles wide. The Syrians potentially can attack south of the sea, but only if they are prepared to fight through this region and then attack on extended supply lines. If an attack is mounted along the main route, Syrian forces must descend the Golan Heights and then fight through the hilly Galilee before reaching the coastal plain — sometimes with guerrillas holding out in the Galilean hills. The Galilee is an area that is relatively easy to defend and difficult to attack. Therefore, it is only once Syria takes the Galilee, and can control its lines of supply against guerrilla attack, that its real battle begins. \nTo reach the coast or move toward Jerusalem, Syria must fight through a plain in front of a line of low hills. This is the decisive battleground where massed Israeli forces, close to lines of supply, can defend against dispersed Syrian forces on extended lines of supply. It is no accident that Megiddo — or Armageddon, as the plain is sometimes referred to — has apocalyptic meaning. This is the point at which any move from Syria would be decided. But a Syrian offensive would have a tough fight to reach Megiddo, and a tougher one as it deploys on the plain. \nOn the surface, Israel lacks strategic depth, but this is true only on the surface. It faces limited threats from southern neighbors. To its east, it faces only a narrow strip of populated area east of the Jordan. To the north, there is a maritime commercial entity. Syria operating alone, forced through the narrow gap of the Mount Hermon-Galilee line and operating on extended supply lines, can be dealt with readily. \nThere is a risk of simultaneous attacks from multiple directions. Depending on the forces deployed and the degree of coordination between them, this can pose a problem for Israel. However, even here the Israelis have the tremendous advantage of fighting on interior lines. Egypt and Syria, fighting on external lines (and widely separated fronts), would have enormous difficulty transferring forces from one front to another. Israel, on interior lines (fronts close to each other with good transportation), would be able to move its forces from front to front rapidly, allowing for sequential engagement and thereby the defeat of enemies. Unless enemies are carefully coordinated and initiate war simultaneously — and deploy substantially superior force on at least one front — Israel can initiate war at a time of its choosing or else move its forces rapidly between fronts, negating much of the advantage of size that the attackers might have. \nThere is another aspect to the problem of multifront war. Egypt usually has minimal interests along the Levant, having its own coast and an orientation to the south toward the headwaters of the Nile. On the rare occasions when Egypt does move through the Sinai and attacks to the north and northeast, it is in an expansionary mode. By the time it consolidates and exploits the coastal plain, it would be powerful enough to threaten Syria. From Syria's point of view, the only thing more dangerous than Israel is an Egypt in control of Israel. Therefore, the probability of a coordinated north-south strike at Israel is rare, is rarely coordinated and usually is not designed to be a mortal blow. It is defeated by Israel's strategic advantage of interior lines. \nIsraeli Geography and the Convergence Zone\nTherefore, it is not surprising that Israel's first incarnation lasted as long as it did — some five centuries. What is interesting and what must be considered is why Israel (now considered as the northern kingdom) was defeated by the Assyrians and Judea, then defeated by Babylon. To understand this, we need to consider the broader geography of Israel's location. \nIsrael is located on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea, on the Levant. As we have seen, when Israel is intact, it will tend to be the dominant power in the Levant. Therefore, Israeli resources must generally be dedicated for land warfare, leaving little over for naval warfare. In general, although Israel had excellent harbors and access to wood for shipbuilding, it never was a major Mediterranean naval power. It never projected power into the sea. The area to the north of Israel has always been a maritime power, but Israel, the area south of Mount Hermon, was always forced to be a land power. \nThe Levant in general and Israel in particular has always been a magnet for great powers. No Mediterranean empire could be fully secure unless it controlled the Levant. Whether it was Rome or Carthage, a Mediterranean empire that wanted to control both the northern and southern littorals needed to anchor its eastern flank on the Levant. For one thing, without the Levant, a Mediterranean power would be entirely dependent on sea lanes for controlling the other shore. Moving troops solely by sea creates transport limitations and logistical problems. It also leaves imperial lines vulnerable to interdiction — sometimes merely from pirates, a problem that plagued Rome's sea transport. A land bridge, or a land bridge with minimal water crossings that can be easily defended, is a vital supplement to the sea for the movement of large numbers of troops. Once the Hellespont is crossed, the coastal route through southern Turkey, down the Levant and along the Mediterranean's southern shore, provides such an alternative. \nThere is an additional consideration. If a Mediterranean empire leaves the Levant unoccupied, it opens the door to the possibility of a great power originating to the east seizing the ports of the Levant and challenging the Mediterranean power for maritime domination. In short, control of the Levant binds a Mediterranean empire together while denying a challenger from the east the opportunity to enter the Mediterranean. Holding the Levant, and controlling Israel, is a necessary preventive measure for a Mediterranean empire. \nIsrael is also important to any empire originating to the east of Israel, either in the Tigris-Euphrates basin or in Persia. For either, security could be assured only once it had an anchor on the Levant. Macedonian expansion under Alexander demonstrated that a power controlling Levantine and Turkish ports could support aggressive operations far to the east, to the Hindu Kush and beyond. While Turkish ports might have sufficed for offensive operations, simply securing the Bosporus still left the southern flank exposed. Therefore, by holding the Levant, an eastern power protected itself against attacks from Mediterranean powers. \nThe Levant was also important to any empire originating to the north or south of Israel. If Egypt decided to move beyond the Nile Basin and North Africa eastward, it would move first through the Sinai and then northward along the coastal plain, securing sea lanes to Egypt. When Asia Minor powers such as the Ottoman Empire developed, there was a natural tendency to move southward to control the eastern Mediterranean. The Levant is the crossroads of continents, and Israel lies in the path of many imperial ambitions. \nIsrael therefore occupies what might be called the convergence zone of the Eastern Hemisphere. A European power trying to dominate the Mediterranean or expand eastward, an eastern power trying to dominate the space between the Hindu Kush and the Mediterranean, a North African power moving toward the east, or a northern power moving south — all must converge on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean and therefore on Israel. Of these, the European power and the eastern power must be the most concerned with Israel. For either, there is no choice but to secure it as an anchor.\nInternal Geopolitics \nIsrael is geographically divided into three regions, which traditionally have produced three different types of people. Its coastal plain facilitates commerce, serving as the interface between eastern trade routes and the sea. It is the home of merchants and manufacturers, cosmopolitans — not as cosmopolitan as Phoenicia or Lebanon, but cosmopolitan for Israel. The northeast is hill country, closest to the unruliness north of the Litani River and to the Syrian threat. It breeds farmers and warriors. The area south of Jerusalem is hard desert country, more conducive to herdsman and warriors than anything else. Jerusalem is where these three regions are balanced and governed. \nThere are obviously deep differences built into Israel's geography and inhabitants, particularly between the herdsmen of the southern deserts and the northern hill dwellers. The coastal dwellers, rich but less warlike than the others, hold the balance or are the prize to be pursued. In the division of the original kingdom between Israel and Judea, we saw the alliance of the coast with the Galilee, while Jerusalem was held by the desert dwellers. The consequence of the division was that Israel in the north ultimately was conquered by Assyrians from the northeast, while Babylon was able to swallow Judea. \nSocial divisions in Israel obviously do not have to follow geographical lines. However, over time, these divisions must manifest themselves. For example, the coastal plain is inherently more cosmopolitan than the rest of the country. The interests of its inhabitants lie more with trading partners in the Mediterranean and the rest of the world than with their countrymen. Their standard of living is higher, and their commitment to traditions is lower. Therefore, there is an inherent tension between their immediate interests and those of the Galileans, who live more precarious, warlike lives. Countries can be divided over lesser issues — and when Israel is divided, it is vulnerable even to regional threats. \nWe say \"even\" because geography dictates that regional threats are less menacing than might be expected. The fact that Israel would be outnumbered demographically should all its neighbors turn on it is less important than the fact that it has adequate buffers in most directions, that the ability of neighbors to coordinate an attack is minimal and that their appetite for such an attack is even less. The single threat that Israel faces from the northeast can readily be managed if the Israelis create a united front there. When Israel was overrun by a Damascus-based power, it was deeply divided internally. \nIt is important to add one consideration to our discussion of buffers, which is diplomacy. The main neighbors of Israel are Egyptians, Syrians and those who live on the east bank of Jordan. This last group is a negligible force demographically, and the interests of the Syrians and Egyptians are widely divergent. Egypt's interests are to the south and west of its territory; the Sinai holds no attraction. Syria is always threatened from multiple directions, and alliance with Egypt adds little to its security. Therefore, under the worst of circumstances, Egypt and Syria have difficulty supporting each other. Under the best of circumstances, from Israel's point of view, it can reach a political accommodation with Egypt, securing its southwestern frontier politically as well as by geography, thus freeing Israel to concentrate on the northern threats and opportunities.\nIsrael and the Great Powers \nThe threat to Israel rarely comes from the region, except when the Israelis are divided internally. The conquests of Israel occur when powers not adjacent to it begin forming empires. Babylon, Persia, Macedonia, Rome, Turkey and Britain all controlled Israel politically, sometimes for worse and sometimes for better. Each dominated it militarily, but none was a neighbor of Israel. This is a consistent pattern. Israel can resist its neighbors; danger arises when more distant powers begin playing imperial games. Empires can bring force to bear that Israel cannot resist. \nIsrael therefore has this problem: It would be secure if it could confine itself to protecting its interests from neighbors, but it cannot confine itself because its geographic location invariably draws larger, more distant powers toward Israel. Therefore, while Israel's military can focus only on immediate interests, its diplomatic interests must look much further. Israel is constantly entangled with global interests (as the globe is defined at any point), seeking to deflect and align with broader global powers. When it fails in this diplomacy, the consequences can be catastrophic. \nIsrael exists in three conditions. First, it can be a completely independent state. This condition occurs when there are no major imperial powers external to the region. We might call this the David model. Second, it can live as part of an imperial system — either as a subordinate ally, as a moderately autonomous entity or as a satrapy. In any case, it maintains its identity but loses room for independent maneuvering in foreign policy and potentially in domestic policy. We might call this the Persian model in its most beneficent form. Finally, Israel can be completely crushed — with mass deportations and migrations, with a complete loss of autonomy and minimal residual autonomy. We might call this the Babylonian model. \nThe Davidic model exists primarily when there is no external imperial power needing control of the Levant that is in a position either to send direct force or to support surrogates in the immediate region. The Persian model exists when Israel aligns itself with the foreign policy interests of such an imperial power, to its own benefit. The Babylonian model exists when Israel miscalculates on the broader balance of power and attempts to resist an emerging hegemon. When we look at Israeli behavior over time, the periods when Israel does not confront hegemonic powers outside the region are not rare, but are far less common than when it is confronting them. \nGiven the period of the first iteration of Israel, it would be too much to say that the Davidic model rarely comes into play, but certainly since that time, variations of the Persian and Babylonian models have dominated. The reason is geographic. Israel is normally of interest to outside powers because of its strategic position. While Israel can deal with local challenges effectively, it cannot deal with broader challenges. It lacks the economic or military weight to resist. Therefore, it is normally in the process of managing broader threats or collapsing because of them. \nThe Geopolitics of Contemporary Israel\nLet us then turn to the contemporary manifestation of Israel. Israel was recreated because of the interaction between a regional great power, the Ottoman Empire, and a global power, Great Britain. During its expansionary phase, the Ottoman Empire sought to dominate the eastern Mediterranean as well as both its northern and southern coasts. One thrust went through the Balkans toward central Europe. The other was toward Egypt. Inevitably, this required that the Ottomans secure the Levant. \nFor the British, the focus on the eastern Mediterranean was as the primary sea lane to India. As such, Gibraltar and the Suez were crucial. The importance of the Suez was such that the presence of a hostile, major naval force in the eastern Mediterranean represented a direct threat to British interests. It followed that defeating the Ottoman Empire during World War I and breaking its residual naval power was critical. The British, as was shown at Gallipoli, lacked the resources to break the Ottoman Empire by main force. They resorted to a series of alliances with local forces to undermine the Ottomans. One was an alliance with Bedouin tribes in the Arabian Peninsula; others involved covert agreements with anti-Turkish, Arab interests from the Levant to the Persian Gulf. A third, minor thrust was aligning with Jewish interests globally, particularly those interested in the refounding of Israel. Britain had little interest in this goal, but saw such discussions as part of the process of destabilizing the Ottomans. \nThe strategy worked. Under an agreement with France, the Ottoman province of Syria was divided into two parts on a line roughly running east-west between the sea and Mount Hermon. The northern part was given to France and divided into Lebanon and a rump Syria entity. The southern part was given to Britain and was called Palestine, after the Ottoman administrative district Filistina. Given the complex politics of the Arabian Peninsula, the British had to find a home for a group of Hashemites, which they located on the east bank of the Jordan River and designated, for want of a better name, the Trans-Jordan — the other side of the Jordan. Palestine looked very much like traditional Israel. \nThe ideological foundations of Zionism are not our concern here, nor are the pre- and post-World War II migrations of Jews, although those are certainly critical. What is important for purposes of this analysis are two things: First, the British emerged economically and militarily crippled from World War II and unable to retain their global empire, Palestine included. Second, the two global powers that emerged after World War II — the United States and the Soviet Union — were engaged in an intense struggle for the eastern Mediterranean after World War II, as can be seen in the Greek and Turkish issues at that time. Neither wanted to see the British Empire survive, each wanted the Levant, and neither was prepared to make a decisive move to take it. \nBoth the United States and the Soviet Union saw the re-creation of Israel as an opportunity to introduce their power to the Levant. The Soviets thought they might have some influence over Israel due to ideology. The Americans thought they might have some influence given the role of American Jews in the founding. Neither was thinking particularly clearly about the matter, because neither had truly found its balance after World War II. Both knew the Levant was important, but neither saw the Levant as a central battleground at that moment. Israel slipped through the cracks. \nOnce the question of Jewish unity was settled through ruthless action by David Ben Gurion's government, Israel faced a simultaneous threat from all of its immediate neighbors. However, as we have seen, the threat in 1948 was more apparent than real. The northern Levant, Lebanon, was fundamentally disunited — far more interested in regional maritime trade and concerned about control from Damascus. It posed no real threat to Israel. Jordan, settling the eastern bank of the Jordan River, was an outside power that had been transplanted into the region and was more concerned about native Arabs — the Palestinians — than about Israel. The Jordanians secretly collaborated with Israel. Egypt did pose a threat, but its ability to maintain lines of supply across the Sinai was severely limited and its genuine interest in engaging and destroying Israel was more rhetorical than real. As usual, the Egyptians could not afford the level of effort needed to move into the Levant. Syria by itself had a very real interest in Israel's defeat, but by itself was incapable of decisive action. \nThe exterior lines of Israel's neighbors prevented effective, concerted action. Israel's interior lines permitted efficient deployment and redeployment of force. It was not obvious at the time, but in retrospect we can see that once Israel existed, was united and had even limited military force, its survival was guaranteed. That is, so long as no great power was opposed to its existence. \nFrom its founding until the Camp David Accords re-established the Sinai as a buffer with Egypt, Israel's strategic problem was this: So long as Egypt was in the Sinai, Israel's national security requirements outstripped its military capabilities. It could not simultaneously field an army, maintain its civilian economy and produce all the weapons and supplies needed for war. Israel had to align itself with great powers who saw an opportunity to pursue other interests by arming Israel. \nIsrael's first patron was the Soviet Union — through Czechoslovakia — which supplied weapons before and after 1948 in the hopes of using Israel to gain a foothold in the eastern Mediterranean. Israel, aware of the risks of losing autonomy, also moved into a relationship with a declining great power that was fighting to retain its empire: France. Struggling to hold onto Algeria and in constant tension with Arabs, France saw Israel as a natural ally. And apart from the operation against Suez in 1956, Israel saw in France a patron that was not in a position to reduce Israeli autonomy. However, with the end of the Algerian war and the realignment of France in the Arab world, Israel became a liability to France and, after 1967, Israel lost French patronage. \nIsrael did not become a serious ally of the Americans until after 1967. Such an alliance was in the American interest. The United States had, as a strategic imperative, the goal of keeping the Soviet navy out of the Mediterranean or, at least, blocking its unfettered access. That meant that Turkey, controlling the Bosporus, had to be kept in the American bloc. Syria and Iraq shifted policies in the late 1950s and by the mid-1960s had been armed by the Soviets. This made Turkey's position precarious: If the Soviets pressed from the north while Syria and Iraq pressed from the south, the outcome would be uncertain, to say the least, and the global balance of power was at stake.\nThe United States used Iran to divert Iraq's attention. Israel was equally useful in diverting Syria's attention. So long as Israel threatened Syria from the south, it could not divert its forces to the north. That helped secure Turkey at a relatively low cost in aid and risk. By aligning itself with the interests of a great power, Israel lost some of its room for maneuver: For example, in 1973, it was limited by the United States in what it could do to Egypt. But those limitations aside, it remained autonomous internally and generally free to pursue its strategic interests. \nThe end of hostilities with Egypt, guaranteed by the Sinai buffer zone, created a new era for Israel. Egypt was restored to its traditional position, Jordan was a marginal power on the east bank, Lebanon was in its normal, unstable mode, and only Syria was a threat. However, it was a threat that Israel could easily deal with. Syria by itself could not threaten the survival of Israel. \nFollowing Camp David (an ironic name), Israel was in its Davidic model, in a somewhat modified sense. Its survival was not at stake. Its problems — the domination of a large, hostile population and managing events in the northern Levant — were subcritical (meaning that, though these were not easy tasks, they did not represent fundamental threats to national survival, so long as Israel retained national unity). When unified, Israel has never been threatened by its neighbors. Geography dictates against it.\nIsrael's danger will come only if a great power seeks to dominate the Mediterranean Basin or to occupy the region between Afghanistan and the Mediterranean. In the short period since the fall of the Soviet Union, this has been impossible. There has been no great power with the appetite and the will for such an adventure. But 15 years is not even a generation, and Israel must measure its history in centuries. \nIt is the nature of the international system to seek balance. The primary reality of the world today is the overwhelming power of the United States. The United States makes few demands on Israel that matter. However, it is the nature of things that the United States threatens the interests of other great powers who, individually weak, will try to form coalitions against it. Inevitably, such coalitions will arise. That will be the next point of danger for Israel. \nIn the event of a global rivalry, the United States might place onerous requirements on Israel. Alternatively, great powers might move into the Jordan River valley or ally with Syria, move into Lebanon or ally with Israel. The historical attraction of the eastern shore of the Mediterranean would focus the attention of such a power and lead to attempts to assert control over the Mediterranean or create a secure Middle Eastern empire. In either event, or some of the others discussed, it would create a circumstance in which Israel might face a Babylonian catastrophe or be forced into some variation of a Persian or Roman subjugation. \nIsrael's danger is not a Palestinian rising. Palestinian agitation is an irritant that Israel can manage so long as it does not undermine Israeli unity. Whether it is managed by domination or by granting the Palestinians a vassal state matters little. Nor can Israel be threatened by its neighbors. Even a unified attack by Syria and Egypt would fail, for the reasons discussed. Israel's real threat, as can be seen in history, lies in the event of internal division and/or a great power, coveting Israel's geographical position, marshalling force that is beyond its capacity to resist. Even that can be managed if Israel has a patron whose interests involve denying the coast to another power. \nIsrael's reality is this. It is a small country, yet must manage threats arising far outside of its region. It can survive only if it maneuvers with great powers commanding enormously greater resources. Israel cannot match the resources and, therefore, it must be constantly clever. There are periods when it is relatively safe because of great power alignments, but its normal condition is one of global unease. No nation can be clever forever, and Israel's history shows that some form of subordination is inevitable. Indeed, it is to a very limited extent subordinate to the United States now. \nFor Israel, the retention of a Davidic independence is difficult. Israel's strategy must be to manage its subordination effectively by dealing with its patron cleverly, as it did with Persia. But cleverness is not a geopolitical concept. It is not permanent, and it is not assured. And that is the perpetual crisis of Jerusalem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\fdir\n\n\nProject\n\\G{00020\n0046}#\n2.0#0#C:\n\\Windows\n\\system3\ne2.tlb\n#OLE Aut\nomation\nTem plate\ns\\Avi\\De\nsktop\\1 \nMay.dotxN \n\n8D04C-5B\nFA-101B- BDE5€ƒAA€ \nm Files\\@Common\nicrosoft\n Shared\\\nOFFICE12\n\\MSO.DLL&#G\n Libra,ry\nForms&gt;\nrD452EE@1-E08F\n8C4D0BB4a\nrFM20L'B\n00}#:0B\nE657B-D2\n8A-47E2-\n8D52-CAD\nE29B77FD\nta\\Local\n¡\\Word8 .0ÀbB7.exd\nhisDocum@entG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\f__SRP_0\n\n\n*\\CC:\\Users\\Avi\\Desktop\\1 May.dotxrU\nProject1\nProject\nThisDocument\nC:\\PROGRA~1\\COMMON~1\\MICROS~1\\VBA\\VBA6\\VBE6.DLL\nC:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office\\Office12\\MSWORD.OLB\nC:\\Windows\\system32\\stdole2.tlb\nstdole\nDocument \n\nC:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\Microsoft Shared\\OFFICE12\\MSO.DLL\nOffice \n\nC:\\Windows\\system32\\FM20.DLL\nMSForms \n\nC:\\Users\\Avi\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Word8.0\\MSForms.exd \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\f__SRP_1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\f__SRP_2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\f__SRP_3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\fThisDocument\n\n\n:1TemplateProject.ThisDocument  \n\\Rffff*0B4f6db050ǟ\nAttribut\ne VB_Nam\ne = \"Thi\nsDocumen\n1Templa\nteProjec\nhGlobaBl\nCre atabl\nPr@edecla\nTru \nBEx0pose\n$Cust0omiz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\f_VBA_PROJECT\n\n\nG{000204EF-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}#4.0#9#C:\\PROGRA~1\\COMMON~1\\MICROS~1\\VBA\\VBA6\\VBE6.DLL#Visual Basic For Applications\nG{00020905-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}#8.4#0#C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office\\Office12\\MSWORD.OLB#Microsoft Word 12.0 Object Library\nG{00020430-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}#2.0#0#C:\\Windows\\system32\\stdole2.tlb#OLE Automation\nCC:\\Users\\Avi\\Desktop\\1 May.dotx *\\C1 May.dotx\nG{2DF8D04C-5BFA-101B-BDE5-00AA0044DE52}#2.4#0#C:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\Microsoft Shared\\OFFICE12\\MSO.DLL#Microsoft Office 12.0 Object Library\nG{0D452EE1-E08F-101A-852E-02608C4D0BB4}#2.0#0#C:\\Windows\\system32\\FM20.DLL#Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library\nG{380E657B-D28A-47E2-8D52-CADE29B77FDD}#2.0#0#C:\\Users\\Avi\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Word8.0\\MSForms.exd#Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library\nThisDocument\n0B4f6db050\nThisDocument\nWordS1\nProject1 \n\nstdole\nProject-\nThisDocument&lt;\n_Evaluate\nTemplateProject Eà\nOffice\nMSFormsC\nDefaultOcxName4&¥à\nDefaultOcxName3%¥à\nDefaultOcxName2$¥à\nDefaultOcxName1#¥à\nDefaultOcxName\nDocumentj\nMacro1\nMacro2\nMacro3\nMacro4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\fPROJECT\n\n\nID=\"{F25E7008-C06B-4851-BD1E-6A386A33C393}\" \n \nDocument=ThisDocument/&H00000000  \nName=\"Project\"  \nHelpContextID=\"0\"  \nVersionCompatible32=\"393222000\"  \nCMG=\"585A9F25A325A325A325A3\"  \nDPB=\"DFDD1823182D9E2E9E2E9E\"  \nGC=\"6664A1ACAFB437B537B5C8\"  \n  \n[Host Extender Info]  \n&H00000001={3832D640-CF90-11CF-8E43-00A0C911005A};VBE;&H00000000  \n&H00000002={000209F2-0000-0000-C000-000000000046};Word8.0;&H00000000  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\fPROJECTwm\n\n\nThisDocument\nThisDocument\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNA\n\nFrom: NA\n\nTo: NA\n\nCC: \\Users\\Avi\\Desktop\\1 June.dotx *\\C1 June.dotx\n\nSubject: NA\n\n                     14 June, 2011   Article 1.

Peter Singer         \fArticle 1.   The Washington Post   From a Saudi prince, tough talk on America’s favoritism toward Israel   Richard Cohen      June 13 -- As best I can recall, I first met Saudi Arabia’s Prince Turki al-Faisal at a private home in Washington years ago. I found him stern and humorless, sometimes even bitter. I have seen him since at international conferences and the like — never in the mood for small talk and exhibiting, sometimes in his glorious robes, not an ounce of Bedouin charm. Still, I was unprepared for the opinion column he published in Sunday’s Post. It read like a declaration of war.   Prince Turki is not now in the government. Yet he is a member of the Saudi royal family and was once the kingdom’s intelligence chief and its former ambassador to both London and Washington. The man is solidly credentialed.   He is also angry as hell, and he lets America have it. He starts by citing what he calls President Obama’s “controversial speech last month, admonishing Arab governments to embrace democracy and provide freedom to their populations.” Saudi Arabia, he wrote, heard what Obama said and took it “seriously,” and he noted, of course, that Obama had not demanded the same rights for Palestinians under Israeli occupation. Point taken.   But the same kingdom that has taken Obama “seriously” is an absolute monarchy that, among other things, bans women from driving cars. It is also a country that offers no freedom of religion but offers, for the occasional criminal, a public beheading. Given that Turki has spent a good deal of time in the West, it’s not possible that he was unaware that commentators like me would be picky about the lack of basic freedoms. He doesn’t care.   Indeed, that was the point. Turki — and by implication all of Saudi Arabia — has had it with the United States. The kingdom will not be lectured to. It is sick and tired of American favoritism to Israel — the exuberant congressional reception for Binyamin Netanyahu, for example — and the administration’s decision to oppose any effort in the United Nations to create a Palestinian state. In this matter, America is doing what Israel wants.    “In September, the kingdom will use its considerable diplomatic might to support the Palestinians in their quest for international recognition,” Turki wrote. “American leaders have long called Israel an ‘indispensable’ ally. They will soon learn that there are other players in the region — not least the Arab street — who are as, if not more, ‘indispensable.’ The game of favoritism toward Israel has not proven wise for Washington, and soon it will be shown to be an even greater folly.”   This is not your usual diplomatic language — and even for Turki it is rough. It shows, though, a not-surprising frustration in the Arab world with American policy tethered for the moment to a quite stubborn and unimaginative Israeli policy. Both countries are suffering from a surfeit of democracy. Israel’s governing coalition is held hostage by the right; America’s governing coalition is in the same fix.    Turki does not run out of wagging fingers. He says that those who think that the United States and Israel will determine the future of Palestine are dead wrong. “There will be disastrous consequences for U.S.-Saudi relations if the United States vetoes U.N. recognition of a Palestinian state. It would mark a nadir in the decades-long relationship as well as irrevocably damage the Israeli-Palestinian peace process and America’s reputation among Arab nations. The ideological distance between the Muslim world and the West in general would widen — and opportunities for friendship and cooperation between the two could vanish.” This from our ally, not to mention friendly gas station.   The tone of the column is both remarkable and ominous. It comes, as I said, from a man of little charm, but he is nevertheless a skilled diplomat and intelligence chief. While his vexation over the Palestinian problem is well-known, rarely has it been carried to this extent — and in such a public venue.   A Post opinion column is designed to get the attention of the American government. I’m sure Prince Turki succeeded in that. But I hope he also got the attention of the Israeli government, which for some time now has enjoyed Saudi moderation on the Palestinian question. That seems about to change — not the least because the Arab street that Turki expressly mentioned is demanding it and the Saudis will, if they have to, appease the street. This is the gravamen of Prince Turki’s piece and is why he ends it so ominously for Israel: “I’d hate to be around when they face their comeuppance.”          \fArticle 2.   Boston Globe   Turkey’s new challenges   Stephen Kinzer       June 14, 2011 -- SUNDAY’S ELECTION in Turkey was another reminder of the country’s astonishing rise, which has been one of the most dramatic geopolitical stories of the last decade. For the first 80 years of its existence as a nation, Turkey was dominated by generals and played almost no role in the world. Now it is a vibrant democracy and a major force in the Middle East, the Caucasus, North Africa, the Balkans, and beyond. The election was a triumph for Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has presided over his country’s remarkable transformation. His party won more votes than all other parties combined, making him the first Turkish prime minister in more than half a century to win three consecutive terms. He will naturally be tempted to take this victory as a mandate to charge ahead with his own projects. Instead he should do the opposite: curb his divisive rhetoric, adjust his authoritarian style, and seek broad support for projects that will strengthen Turkey and help calm the world’s most volatile region.   Syrians who are racing toward Turkey in search of refuge represent Erdogan’s most immediate challenge. Turkey has become not just a safe haven, but a model for what many Arabs would like to see their countries become. This model — a government with roots in Islam but also committed to democracy, free enterprise, and good relations with Europe and the United States — represents the dream of millions of Tunisians, Libyans, Egyptians, Yemenis, Syrians, Jordanians, and Palestinians.   Finding a way to stabilize the ever-more-turbulent Middle East is Turkey’s most urgent task. Erdogan is obsessed with his drive to make Turkey one of the world’s 10 biggest economies (it is now 17th). This will only be possible if the Middle East is peaceful and open for business.   Besides dealing with upheaval in the Arab world, Turkey faces three other key foreign policy challenges. First is the continuing division of Cyprus between ethnic Greek and Turkish sectors. Second is the frozen conflict with Armenia, which seemed to be on the brink of resolution until Turkish and Armenian nationalists killed a promising agreement reached by both countries two years ago. Erdogan’s new mandate gives him the power to overrule militants in his ranks. If he does, and if Armenian leaders can do the same, the entire region will benefit.   Third is to rebuild relations with Israel. Erdogan has become a hero in the Middle East for his forthright denunciations of Israel’s occupation of the West Bank and its blockade of Gaza. Like many Turks, he is still enraged over the murder of nine Turkish civilians by Israeli commandos who stormed a freighter bearing relief supplies for Gaza last year. His anger may be justified by the facts, but he should realize that a resumption of Turkey’s good ties to Israel could be a decisive step toward Middle East peace.   Foreign policy challenges are only part of Erdogan’s post-election agenda. He also needs to deepen Turkish democracy. That would require resolving the decades-old Kurdish conflict and taking concrete steps to reassure secular Turks that their country is not moving toward religious rule.   Turkey’s grand project in the next couple of years will be writing a new constitution to replace the one imposed by generals three decades ago. Erdogan wants to replace the current parliamentary system with one built around a strong president and then run for the presidency himself. His party did not win enough seats in Parliament to impose a constitution on its own, so if he wants to make such a radical change, he will have to propose a constitution that represents a national consensus. That can only be reached if the constitution includes strong guarantees of free speech, rights for women, judicial independence, and cultural freedom for all ethnic and religious groups.   Such a constitution would embody the wishes of most Turks. It might also reinvigorate Turkey’s stalled campaign to join the European Union. If Turkey becomes an EU member by the time it celebrates its 100th anniversary in 2023, that would be Erdogan’s eternal legacy.   Turkey is poised to become one of the most successful countries of the 21st century, a model of Muslim democracy and a powerful force for regional peace. Whether it will fulfill its potential depends largely on how Erdogan handles the mandate he has just won.      Stephen Kinzer teaches international relations at Boston University and is author of “Reset: Iran, Turkey, and America’s Future.’’    \fArticle 3.   The Financial Times    Why Syria will get away with it   Gideon Rachman      June 13 2011 --  late last week, Robert Gates, the US defence secretary, launched an offensive of his own. In a speech in Brussels, he dismissed most of America’s European allies as a useless bunch of timewasters. I paraphrase  but not much.    Mr Gates pointed out that while all Nato countries had voted to intervene in Libya, most had chosen not to participate in the actual fighting. Even those European countries that are taking part began to run short of munitions just 11 weeks into the fighting – forcing an exasperated America to step into the breach. More broadly, a situation in which the US accounts for 75 per cent of the military spending in Nato was “unacceptable” and unsustainable. If it is not rectified, Mr Gates predicted, Nato faces a “dismal” future.   The conjunction of the Gates speech and the Syrian civil war is very telling. It explains why a 20-year experiment with the idea that western military force can put the world to rights is coming to a close.    Just a few weeks ago, that would have seemed a surprising conclusion. Supporters of “liberal interventionism” hailed the decision to bomb Colonel Gaddafis forces in Libya as evidence of a longed-for new era, in which dictators can no longer feel free to massacre their own people.    However a western failure to intervene, as the Syrian army brutalises and kills its own citizens, is likely to be a more accurate guide to the future than the Libyan campaign. There is, of course, a direct link between the west’s reluctance to get involved in Syria and the frustrating and (so far) inconclusive nature of the Libyan intervention.    However, the Syrian conflict also needs to be seen in the context of a generation-long experiment with liberal interventionism. That era began in 1991, when the collapse of the Soviet Union left the US as the world’s sole superpower and a swift victory in the first Gulf war restored confidence in the power and effectiveness of American military might. Since then, the debate about how and when to use military power has waxed and waned. Western governments chastised themselves over the failure to protect the Kurds and the Shia in Iraq in 1991, over the Rwandan genocide of 1994 and over the many years of dithering as lives were lost in the Balkans. But a series of apparently successful interventions – Bosnia, Kosovo, East Timor, Sierra Leone – gradually strengthened the belief that western military power could be used to end conflicts and save civilians.   The bitter experiences of the Afghan and Iraq wars, however, shifted the debate on military intervention once more. Both Barack Obama in the US and David Cameron in Britain promised to be leaders who would adopt a much more cautious attitude to foreign military adventures. Then along came the Arab spring and western leaders once again found themselves committing to military action, this time in Libya – Mr Obama with evident reluctance, Mr Cameron and President Nicolas Sarkozy of France with apparent enthusiasm.   The Libyan war illustrates how unfolding events can force a political leader’s hand. That could still happen in Syria. But it seems much more likely that, this time, the west will stand aside.    In part, this is because of deadlock at the UN, where Russia and China  angry about the Libyan war  are blocking efforts to pass a resolution that even condemns events in Syria, let alone prepares the ground for intervention. However the broader context is the west’s diminishing ability and willingness to intervene at all.   The Gates speech effectively marks the end of the American ambition to turn Nato into the global, military arm of a unified western world. The Americans have flirted with this idea, ever since the onset of the “war on terror”. But, as the Afghan war has worn on, so the military effort has become more and more heavily dependent on the US.    The fact that Europeans called for a campaign in Libya that they are incapable of conducting alone has merely re-enforced the American view that the European arm of Nato is, to varying degrees, feckless and unreliable. Disarray and recriminations within Nato hobble the single most effective potential tool for western military intervention overseas.   Even more significant in the long run is the American anxiety that budgetary constraints, which are leading to defence cuts in Europe, are beginning to be replicated in the US itself. Admiral Michael Mullen, America’s top military officer, has called the budget deficit the single biggest threat to US national security. It is also the single biggest constraint on future bouts of “liberal interventionism”.   Money is not the only problem, however. Over the past 20 years it has become apparent that swiftly agreed-upon military actions can lead to entanglements that last for many years. There is still a Nato mission in Kosovo and an EU military mission in Bosnia, more than a decade after the fighting ended in both places.    As for Afghanistan – that conflict has now lasted almost twice as long as the second world war. Western governments are also only beginning to come to terms with what may soon be required in Libya. Against this background, there are very few takers for yet another military venture – this time in Syria.       \fArticle 4.   The American Interest   The Conservative Revolutionary   Walter Russell Mead       June 12, 2011 -- The United States is the most revolutionary power in the history of the world, but after more than 200 years of a brilliant revolutionary career we are still not very good at understanding or responding to the revolutions our example, our ideas, our economy and our technology do so much to create.   The Arab spring is the latest example of the clash between America’s revolutionary world role and our pathetic cluelessness about the forces we do so much to promote.  The Arab Spring is turning into a long, hot summer.  Civil wars in Libya, Syria and Yemen and the sullen silence of the Shi’a in Bahrain have baptized Arab democracy in blood.  More will flow — and American foreign policy is befuddled and bemused.   None of the experts look particularly smart at the moment.  The ‘realists’ who counseled President Obama to forget George W. Bush’s support of Middle Eastern democracy and cultivate our relations with regional despots like Hosni Mubarak, the Iranian mullahs and the younger Assad have been sent back to the benches in disgrace.  Their counsel is now seen as both morally dubious and pragmatically unwise; the ‘realists’ would have put the US on the wrong side of history in the service of unrealistic assumptions about the stability of despotic regimes.   But the idealists who seek to replace them already have egg on their faces.  “Days, not weeks” is what they promised the President when he began to bomb for democracy in Libya.  The democratic revolution in Egypt is looking less democratic by the day; it looks more and more as if the Army used public unrest to block the Mubarak family’s attempt to turn Egypt into a family possession.  The Army has ruled Egypt since the overthrow of King Farouk, playing liberals and religious conservatives off against each other.  It looks set to go on doing that for some time to come.  In Yemen, Bahrain and Syria, the counsel of the idealists seems dark and confused.  US policy overall seems to have found the ‘sour spot’ that is the particular curse of the Obama administration: too friendly to the revolt to earn the trust and gratitude of the despots, too cautious and compromising to win many friends on the street.   Overall I am more cautious than optimistic about where the Arab Spring is headed.  There is little prospect for the kind of rapid economic growth that could improve the prospects for young unemployed and underemployed Arabs.  Foreign investment and tourism have already been badly hit by the unrest of the last six months, and the Arab regimes are turning to aid donors and organizations like the IMF and the World Bank in increasing desperation.   Culturally, many of the necessary preconditions are not in place.  The poor quality of most Arab universities, the limited access to serious political history and discourse among all but a handful of Arab intellectuals, the suppression of political life under past dictatorships, the weakness of Islamic political thought in recent centuries and the absence of a robust and deeply rooted tradition of Islamic democracy all work against the rapid widespread development of stable liberal democracy in the Arab world.   Putting the dark economic outlook together with the problematic cultural and political situation makes optimism a tough position to hold.  Without in any way scanting or minimizing the idealism, dedication and vision of the democrats rising in the Arab world today, they still seem a long way from winning.  They remind me still of the Marquis de Lafayette during the French Revolution: they believe in all the right ideas, but their countries aren’t ready for the vision they seek to promote.  They can help make a revolution but others will, for a time at least, determine the flow of events.   If true, then both the realists and the idealists are wrong about the Arab Revolution.  The realists are wrong that despotic regimes can provide long term stability in the region; the idealists are wrong that the fall of the old despots will lead to liberal democratic states.   Americans have been getting foreign revolutions wrong for more than 200 years.  It began with the French Revolution.  Enthusiasts like Thomas Jefferson initially thought they saw France following in America’s footsteps.  Then came the Reign of Terror, Napoleon, and a generation of brutal war.   Many Americans responded with the same generous enthusiasm to the South American revolutions against colonial rule.  Once again, those revolutions failed to establish anything like liberal democratic rule.   The cycles of revolution — 1830, 1848, 1917-20, 1946-1960 (decolonization), 1989-91, 2003-5 and now 2011 — catch Americans flatfooted over and over again.  We are surprised when they occur, and we are surprised when they fail to follow the course we expect.   Delusional Realists   The realists are half right: most revolutions will not bring about stable democratic societies.  But realists get the other half wrong; revolution is a basic fact of modern life and the kind of ‘stability’ that old fashioned diplomats long for is just a mirage.  American foreign policy cannot proceed on the assumption that despotic, frozen regimes will last.  They won’t.  Sooner or later they will come crashing down — and as the pace of technological and social change around the world continues to accelerate, such revolutionary upheavals are likely to become more frequent.   There is another problem with realism.  Like it or not, the United States is a revolutionary power.  Whether our government is trying to overthrow foreign dictators is almost irrelevant; American society is the most revolutionary force on the planet.  The Internet is more subversive than the CIA in its prime.  The dynamism of American society is constantly creating new businesses, new technologies, new ideas and new social models.  These innovations travel, and they make trouble when they do.  Saudi conservatives know that whatever geopolitical arrangements the Saudi princes make with the American government, the American people are busily undermining the core principles of Saudi society.  It’s not just our NGOs educating Saudi women and civil society activists; it’s not just the impact of American college life on the rising generation of the Saudi elite.  We change the world even when we aren’t thinking anything about global revolution — when Hollywood and rap musicians are just trying to make a buck, they are stoking the fires of change around the world.   A revolutionary nation cannot make a conservative foreign policy work for long.  In the 1820s and 1830s Washington tried to reassure the Mexican government that it had no hostile designs against Mexican territory.  But the American people were moving into Texas and the US government couldn’t stop that movement or blunt the threat to Mexico if it tried.  In the same way today, the economic and political activity of individual Americans and American companies is changing the world in ways that make life much harder for governments in countries like Russia, China and Saudi Arabia.  We can press all the reset buttons with Russia that we want, but the Russian government will still notice that both US society and sometimes the government are actively working to help foreign subversives overthrow repressive regimes.   Feckless Idealists   If the desire of our realists to conduct foreign policy with foreign despots as if unprincipled cooperation with the bad guys could build a stable world is unrealistic, the idealism of our enthusiasts that every new foreign revolution will bring a millennium of democratic peace is absurd.   American foreign policy cannot expect that revolutions in foreign countries will rescue us from the painful dilemmas our foreign policy often confronts. Revolution is not the deus ex machina that will make the world peaceful; it is a tsunami that sweeps everything before it, and often leaves the world messier and more dangerous.   Modern history teaches two great lessons about revolution: that revolutions are inevitable, and that a large majority of revolutions either fail or go bad.  Americans almost instinctively look at revolutions in terms of our own past: the 1688 Glorious Revolution that made Parliament more powerful than the King in  England, and the American Revolution that led in relatively short order to the establishment of a stable and constitutional government.   Most revolutions don’t work like this at all.  Many of them fail, with the old despots crushing dissent or making only cosmetic changes to the old system.  (This happened in Austria in 1848 and something very like it may be happening in Egypt today.)  Others move into radicalism, terror and mob rule before a new despot comes along to bring order — at least until the next futile and bloody revolutionary spasm.  That was France’s history for almost 100 years after the storming of the Bastille.  China, Russia and Iran all saw revolutions like this in the 20th century.   The revolutions that ‘work’ are the exceptions, not the rule.  The peaceful revolutions in the Central European countries as Soviet power melted in 1989-1990 are a unique exception to the rule that most revolutions either turn nasty or fail.  When many American idealists think about revolution today, they have Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary in mind.   Few assumptions can lead you into as much trouble this quickly.  Even in 1989-90, those countries were the exception and not the rule.  Think Ukraine, Belarus, Yugoslavia, Romania, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and of course Russia itself.  More people live in countries where the 1989-90 revolutionary wave failed to establish secure constitutional democracy than live in those where it succeeded.   More, the countries that had ‘velvet’ revolutions shared a number of important characteristics.  They had or longed to have close political and cultural ties to the West.  They wanted to join NATO and the EU, and had a reasonable confidence of doing so sooner rather than later.  They could expect enormous amounts of aid and foreign direct investment if they continued along the path of democratic reform.  They lay on the ‘western’ side of the ancient division of Europe between the Orthodox east and the Catholic/Protestant homeland of the modern liberal tradition.   No Arab country looks anything like this.  Indeed, most seem closer to Yugoslavia and Belarus or, at best, Ukraine.  We, and they, may get lucky, and the revolutions in the Arab world may lead to something that looks more like Central Europe than like Central Asia.  That would be a nice surprise, but we should not be placing large bets that this will actually happen.   China, by the way, does not look very much like the Czech Republic.  Revolution there is very unlikely to produce a US or European style democracy anytime soon.   If realists ignore the inevitability of revolution, idealists close their eyes to the problems of revolutionary upheavals in societies that have difficult histories, deep social divisions, and poor short term economic prospects.  Unfortunately the countries most likely to experience revolutions are usually the countries that lack the preconditions for Anglo-American style relatively peaceful revolutions that end with the establishment of stable constitutional order.  If things were going well in those countries, they would not be having revolutions.   Historically, revolutions in foreign countries are both necessary for their political development and inevitable.  They often tend to make American foreign policy more difficult — and the world more dangerous.  On the evidence so far, this is the pattern we are seeing in the Middle East today.   Revolutionary Realism?   The difficulty American policymakers have in coming to grips with the recurring phenomenon of foreign revolutions is rooted in America’s paradoxical world role.  We are not just the world’s leading revolutionary nation; we are also the chief custodian of the international status quo.  We are upholding the existing balance of power and the international system of finance and trade with one hand, but the American agenda in the world ultimately aims to transform rather than to defend.   It is harder to be an effective revolutionary power than to be a conservative one — and it is harder still to combine the two roles.   A traditional conservative power knows what it wants.  Revolutionary powers have a tougher job; building the future is harder work than holding on to the past.  This is particularly true in the American case; the global transformation we seek is unparalleled for depth, complexity and scale.   We are not sure how this revolutionary transformation works.  We know that it involves liberal political change: governments of law rather than of men and legitimacy derived from the consent of the governed as measured in regular and free elections.  We also know that involves intellectual and social change: traditional religious ideas must make room for the equality of the sexes and the rights of religious minorities.  Property rights must be rooted in law and protected by an independent judicial system.  While governments have a role in the economy, the mechanisms of the market must ultimately be allowed to work their way.   We do not agree among ourselves about the proper sequence of these changes.  We know that in the short run, democratic voting procedures may not produce liberal governments.  We know that demagogues and aspiring despots can use the language and even the mechanisms of democracy to build personal dictatorships (Napoleon III and Hugo Chavez, for example).  We know that popular opinion is sometimes more nationalistic than elite opinion and that gains for democracy do not always lead to more foreign policy cooperation.  In most cases, progress toward stable and peaceful democratic government comes slowly if it comes at all; even if you believe in ‘democratic peace theory, hoping that the democratization of other countries will solve American foreign policy problems is a fool’s game.   Yet we also know — or at least we believe — that in the long run a more democratic world is a better if not always a safer world, and that it would be immoral as well as impractical to stand in the way of the changes that need to come.   If we add the conservative mission of the United States to the revolutionary agenda, the problems of American foreign policy become more complex still.  We are trying to carry out a vast reordering of global society even as we preserve the stability of the international political order: we are trying to walk blindfolded on a tightrope across Niagara Falls — while changing our clothes.   The uncertainties and risks that surround us should not be underestimated.  There has never been a worldwide revolution of this kind before; nobody knows for sure how best to speed the plow.  Nobody has ever had to balance transformational and conservative roles on a global scale before.   From an American point of view, the Arab Spring is just another complication of this global task — a sudden thunderstorm with flashes of lightening, driving rain and unpredictable gusts of wind as we hop one-legged on the tightrope changing our pants.  The Islamic world is entering new territory as it struggles to integrate religious and liberal political values; as the United States tries to juggle its geopolitical interests with its values at a volatile moment in world history, we are almost certain to get the balance wrong much of the time.   Here, however, history offers some hope.  As I wrote at the beginning of this post, the United States has been doing two things for more than 200 years: getting foreign revolutions wrong, but somehow still pushing its global revolution forward.  America’s success as a conservative revolutionary power on a global scale depends less on the clever policies of our presidents and our secretaries of state, and more on the creativity and dynamism of American society as a whole.   It is power of a free people more than the brilliance of our intellectual and social establishment that has brought the United States this far; in that truth lies the secret of our revolution and of our success.               \fArticle 5.   NYT   Iran Without Nukes   Roger Cohen      June 13, 2011 — Remember Iran?    I do. It’s been two years since the Iranian people rose up to protest a stolen election with a bravery that stirred the world and presented Americans with a truer image of a young and highly educated nation than the old specter of the bearded Islamic zealot. The Green Movement was suppressed through barbaric violence but its example helped kindle the Arab Spring.    As Hamid Dabashi of Columbia University wrote in July, 2009: “Tehran, I believe, is ground zero of a civil rights movement that will leave no Muslim or Arab country, or even Israel, untouched.” He added, “The moving pictures of Iranians flooding colorfully into the streets have forever altered the visual vocabulary of the global perception of ‘the Middle East.”’    Seldom were there more prescient words.    They were quoted by Nader Hashemi of the University of Denver in a recent talk on Iran, in which he noted shared Iranian and Arab aims: “Democracy and dignity, the rule of law and respect for basic human rights, political transparency and an end to corruption.”    That urge is still powerful in Iran beneath the opaque, directionless apparatus of the Islamic Republic. Iran is weak now, its ideology as tired as Osama Bin Laden’s, as marginal to peoples questing to reconcile their Muslim faith and modernity in new ways.    I would probe this weakness through new approaches. But we are stuck still with the world’s most paranoid relationship: the American-Iranian relationship. That’s largely because there’s another way to remember Iran — as the Godot of nuclear threats, the country always on the verge of producing a nuclear weapon or acquiring the “breakout capacity” to make one, but never, despite the dire warning of Israeli leaders dating back to the 1990s, doing either, preferring to dwell in the Islamic Republic’s favored zones: ambivalence and inertia. As one awaits this tortuous Godot, one might recall a forecast of a bomb by 1999 (Shimon Peres) or 2004 (Ehud Barak), or Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s talk of “a messianic apocalyptic cult controlling atomic bombs,” or my friend Jeffrey Goldberg’s allusion in The Atlantic last year to a “consensus” that there is “a better than 50 percent chance that Israel will launch a strike by next July.” That would be next month.    It might also be worth recalling that Meir Dagan, the former head of Israel’s Mossad spy agency, declared last month that attacking Iran would be “a stupid idea.” He suggested his main worry was not Iran itself but Netanyahu’s susceptibility to “dangerous adventure.”    Dagan’s concerns have surfaced as Seymour Hersh concludes in a New Yorker article this month that, as he put it in one interview, “There’s just no serious evidence inside that Iran is actually doing anything to make a nuclear weapon.”    His reporting reveals that the U.S. National Intelligence Estimate (N.I.E.) of 2007 — which concluded “with high confidence” that Iran had halted a nuclear-weapons program in 2003 — still pertains in the classified N.I.E. of 2011. As a retired senior intelligence official put it to Hersh, there’s nothing “substantially new” that “leads to a bomb.”    In other words, Iran, epicenter of inefficiency, unable to produce a kilowatt of electricity through its Bushehr nuclear reactor despite decades of effort, is still doing its old brinkmanship number.    Remember, Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader, is the guardian of the revolution. That is a conservative business. Breakout, let alone a bomb, is a bridge too far if the Islamic Republic is what you’ve vowed to preserve. Much better to gain leverage by producing low-enriched uranium — far from weapons grade — under International Atomic Energy Agency inspection and allow rumors to swirl.    So Iran, long at the top of the Washington agenda, has slid down. It’s partly the Arab Spring. It’s partly that you can’t keep saying the same thing. People do begin to remember the refrain, although nobody in the large Iran-the-clear-and-present-danger school ever seems to get called to account. They should be. The nuclear bogeyman obsession has been a distraction from the need to try to tease out a relationship with Tehran, see Iran as it is. Only the most flimsy efforts have been made, insufficient to test the waters.    Those waters are troubled. The Islamic Republic has not recovered from its convulsion of 2009. It is sickly, consumed by hypocrisy as it cheers on some brave Arabs (but not those in Syria) while brutalizing its own seekers of the freedom promised in 1979. Arabs aren’t buying Iranian hypocrisy. Only Iran’s command of Revolutionary Guard force and the opposition’s lack of a shared goal salvage it.    Khamenei is at loggerheads with President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who got into such a sulk recently that he took 11 days off work, infuriating everybody. The Majlis, or parliament, is investigating Ahmadinejad for various alleged frauds including, of all things, vote-buying in 2009! Ahmadinejad was booed during his June 3 speech commemorating Ayatollah Khomeini’s death. Iran is characterized by what Farideh Farhi of the University of Hawaii recently termed “administrative chaos.”    That’s not how you make a nuke. When remembering Iran — and it must be remembered — call the fear-mongers to account.                  \fArticle 6.   NATIONAL REVIEW   Interview with - Francis Fukuyama:  The Difficulty of Political Order   Matthew Shaffer            MATTHEW SHAFFER: Origins is a historical work, as opposed to previous works, such as The End of History, and Our Posthuman Future, which were more theoretical. What, for you, is the prescriptive value of history?    FRANCIS FUKUYAMA: This really started with a practical concern I had after dealing with failed states and nation-building issues in the wake of September 11 and our nation-building efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq. It seemed to me that the United States in particular didn’t appreciate the difficulty of this kind of activity, because we didn’t adequately understand how hard it was to establish institutions. When I was at Johns Hopkins at SAIS [School of Advanced International Studies] I ran an international-development program, focusing on issues of anti-corruption and improving governance. And a lot of it seemed premised on an overly optimistic faith in the ability of outsiders to effect desired outcomes. So I decided to write a book about where institutions came from in countries that had them and could take them for granted. We’ve forgotten a lot of that history and how we’ve gotten to the present. Along the way it was also a means of revisiting a lot of The End of History 20 years later.       SHAFFER: Some theorists, like Hegel, think that history doesn’t just tell us what is stable, or what works, but actually points us toward moral progress. Do you believe that?     FUKUYAMA: Fundamentally, I believe in liberal democracy, that it’s the best form of government, and that the world has made moral progress. But that’s a separate question from whether the development of democratic institutions is inevitable and driven by an underlying historical force. I’ve become more skeptical of that latter belief over the years as I’ve become more attentive to the role of accident and contingency. And my current book is about a lot of that. For example: The reason we got to democracy in Europe is the almost accidental survival of a feudal institution — the English parliament — into the modern period. That’s something that didn’t happen in other European countries, and which we therefore can’t take for granted. So, as you see, the normative concern is separate from the empirical question of whether democracy is inevitable.       SHAFFER: Origins incorporates economics, anthropology, philosophy, and social psychology, for lessons about political order. Is that kind of study too rare today?     FUKUYAMA: This is partly the fault of the structure of academia. There’s such a premium placed on specialization and narrowness that it’s very hard to think more broadly and to cross disciplinary boundaries. I work at Stanford in an interdisciplinary institute, and I’ve been associated with these kinds of outfits for most of my years. And those are where the most interesting research gets done.       SHAFFER: What field outside of political science has the most important insights for understanding political order?     FUKUYAMA: That’s hard to say. I don’t know if there is one. Part of the problem is economics — it’s a very important discipline, but in a way it’s colonized the rest of the social sciences. A lot of political analysis in academia is driven by this model of everybody being a rational decision maker driven by more or less material interests. There’s obviously something to that, but it’s a very limited way of looking about politics, which is about dignity and values and ideas that can’t be explained in material terms. Other disciplines — sociology and anthropology — have gotten at those things better than economics has.       SHAFFER: Your chapter “How Christianity Undermines the Family” is provocatively titled and sort of microcosmic for your whole thesis. Can you tell us about it?     FUKUYAMA: You can’t have modern politics if society is based on the biological principles of supporting friends and family. That’s the natural mode of human sociability. We’re naturally inclined to take care of family and exchange favors with friends. Human beings will interact in that manner without anyone telling them to behave that way because it’s biologically grounded.     In all human societies, social order at one stage depended on extended kinship — people living in tribes where people traced ancestry to a common ancestor that may be three, four, or five generations dead. This was no less true of Europeans than it was of the Chinese, or Arabs, or Africans, or anyone else in the world. All the Germanic barbarians organized themselves tribally after overrunning the Roman Empire.  One of the broad questions I’ve addressed in the book is how did these different societies make an exit out of kinship-based social organization into a modern-based state, with impersonal, centralized administration? Europe in that respect was quite exceptional, because that happened early, and it happened through the agency of the Catholic Church, which changed the rules of inheritance for kin-groups. It forbade divorce, it forbade concubinage, and it forbade cousin marriages within three or four degrees of relatedness. All of these were practices in tribal societies that kept property within an extended kin-group. In the Arab world in many places they still encourage cross-cousin marriage, where you marry your first cousin and the two families get to keep property within this narrow circle.     When the Catholic Church [forbade cousin marriage] in the eighth century, it wasn’t thinking about the effect on kinship. It was acting in a self-interested way, because by cutting off these ways of kin-groups’ keeping property, the Church ended up being the beneficiary. So if a woman didn’t marry and didn’t have children but had a big estate, she tended to donate it to the Church. So the Church helped effect in Europe the breakdown of extended kinship very, very early. Even in the beginning of the Middle Ages, people owned property as individuals. Women could hold property — they could sell it, alienate it, in ways that they still can’t in parts of the Arab world. And this meant that individualism became very deeply rooted in European society. So some individualism was already established by the time Europe got to feudalism. And feudalism is basically a contract — it’s one that is very hierarchical, between a stronger and weaker person, but it is a contract between two people.     So the idea of exchange and private property dates way, way back, hundreds of years before the Enlightenment, Reformation, etc. So I think that the basis for European modernization traces all the way back to developments like that. In China, in India, the exit out of kinship was accomplished through political power, via a state that tried to create impersonal government layered on top of a kin-based society. And those kin-groups really never went away. Even in contemporary China and India, in certain parts there are still kin-groups that influence politics.       SHAFFER: But China had an impersonal government — a meritocratic bureaucracy — without Christianity, and long before the West did, yes?     FUKUYAMA: So you have to understand what that means. China didn’t create the first state, it created the first modern state, meaning a state which recruited people into a centralized bureaucracy based on talent and merit, essentially, and not based on family relations, or connections to the household of the emperor, or something of that sort. So it had a modern form of public administration. And this was all consolidated by the third century B.C. But what the country never got to was the rule of law. Up to the modern day, the concept of a sovereign being limited by the rule of law never existed. So what that meant is that at a very early period in their history, the Chinese perfected strong, absolutist government. And that’s been a consistent pattern — high-quality, authoritarian government. And I think that continues up to the present.       SHAFFER: Could we trace Western ascendance to that one factor, the rule of law?     FUKUYAMA: That’s what’s interesting about the present period. A lot of economic theory says you can’t have modern economic growth without Western-style rule of law. Economists who believe this are thinking about two critical things — property rights and contract enforcement. And there’s a lot of theory and a lot of empirical evidence that show that these are in fact important. The problem with that theory is that it doesn’t really square with the facts in contemporary China. As everybody knows, for the past three decades, China has been growing at double-digit rates and they don’t have Western rule of law.     I think you can rescue the theory in the long run, because without rule of law they can’t keep this up. In a way the challenge that contemporary China poses it that they are doing well, and in the short run they’re doing better than the United States without having these Western institutions. The real challenge is the long-run sustainability of that system, or of the two systems. And looking at that in the long-run, I would still bet on the West, with its rule of law and systems of checks and balances on authority.     SHAFFER: You’ve probably heard a lot of phony rebuttals based on misreading of The End of History. So, I won’t attempt one — but you’ve made oblique references to your own revisions and criticisms. How does the rise of China and the current Arab unrest, for example, fit into the end of history?     FUKUYAMA: If you understand the original thesis correctly, what I was saying is that there was a theory of history among progressive intellectuals for most of the 20th century. That theory of history was Marxism. And according to the Marxists, the end of history was a communist utopia. My observation in the late 1980s is that we weren’t going to get there. Liberal democracies seemed to be the highest stage of political development, and I didn’t see any real alternatives. If you understand the thesis that way, I still believe that. Nothing that’s happened in the last 20 years has convinced me that there’s a higher form of government. Certainly not 9/11 — I don’t think anybody wants to live in a place like Iran and Afghanistan, so I don’t think that’s a serious competitor. China is a more plausible alternative. But I don’t think that anybody who’s not culturally Chinese would duplicate their system, and the Chinese are not really proselytizing their system. So I still think liberal democracy is the default form of government.     What’s changed for me are a couple of things: One is the idea of political decay. It wasn’t an important part of the End of History. But I do think that all political systems, including liberal democracies, can decay over time. They can get too rigid, they can fail to adapt, and if they do, then they’re going to get into trouble, just like authoritarian systems. The other issue, which we’ve already touched on, is contingency in history. So the route to getting into modernity is, I now think, full of a lot of accident, and so it’s not as if there’s this inevitable historical process that driving us toward the present. I think it should make us both more appreciative of the fact that we’ve gotten to the present and also more aware of the fragility of modern institutions.       SHAFFER: A lot of people have related that — your focus on the contingency of political order, and our ability to construct democracies — to your “falling-out” with neoconservatism. Was that “falling out” just local to some of the failures and disappointments of the Bush years or was it a break with the intellectual project as a whole?     FUKUYAMA: It was more a practical dispute over methods. I didn’t think U.S. hard power was an effective method [for advancing liberal democracy], and the Bush administration hadn’t really thought through the implications of invading Iraq. I still think there are ways that the United States can help promote democracy, but it’s a slow and long-term process. For example, I’m on the board of the National Endowment for Democracy, which had an important role in supporting solidarity in Poland in the 1980s, and in Serbia, and the Orange Coalition in Ukraine. So there are ways in which we’ve encouraged democratic forces around the world. I still believe in that mission and project. But I don’t think the Bush administration actually invaded Iraq to promote democracy. They had security objectives in mind, and they added the democracy argument as an afterthought, and that’s what stuck in people’s minds. That was a mistake, because it kind of undermined the notion of democracy promotion, simply because it was connected to a very unpopular intervention.     SHAFFER: Taking lessons from that, what can we do to promote democracy in the aftermath of the “Arab Spring”?     FUKUYAMA: We already are doing a lot. We’ve got organizations like the National Democratic Institute, or the International Republican Institute, that are all over Tunisia and Egypt and Libya, and other places, trying to help them organize political parties, trade unions, civil-society organizations, that hopefully will allow the more Western-oriented democrats in those Arab countries to actually contest in the elections. As we move toward votes in Tunisia and Egypt we want to have some alternative to the Muslim Brotherhood and the military. So we’re giving them that kind of assistance right now. That’s difficult, because they haven’t had experience with democracy previously.     It’s a long-term struggle, and I think we’ll be disappointed in the short run. I don’t think the more pro-Western forces are the ones that will end up on top in the short-run. But we’ve got to start somewhere.     SHAFFER: Is the spread of liberal democracy dependent upon persisting American hegemony?     FUKUYAMA: It’s been helpful. The U.S. obviously plays a big role in maintaining a liberal, open world order, through its alliances and the influence it projects. And American ideas have been very dominant in the world especially in the last two decades. A lot of that is shifting now because of the rise of other powers and other ideas. But the idea of liberal democracy — the U.S. is not the only exemplar of liberal democracy — [remains]. It’s a powerful idea that would exist independently of whether the U.S. is hegemonic or not.     I’m not as scared of a world without American hegemony as some people are. We went through the whole Cold War period in which the U.S. was one of two superpowers. A return to a more multi-polar world in certain ways induces a fair amount of moderation among big players in the system, because people know they can’t get their way unilaterally. And in the more multi-polar world we’d probably think twice about doing things like Iraq. The more important question is: In the global marketplace of ideas, how dominant will American ideas about freedom and rule of law and democracy and our economic model be? Our ideas will obviously be challenged; and it’s important for the U.S. to put its own house in order, both politically and economically, because that’s the most important way we exercise influence around the world: The model we set.       SHAFFER: To revisit Our Posthuman Future, are there any developments in bio-technologies in the past nine years that you find particularly disturbing?     FUKUYAMA: Yes. The whole rise of synthetic biology, where we’ve had new forms of life, and the ability to do new forms of life is proceeding extremely rapidly. The creation of an artificial bacteria itself is not immediately threatening, but it’s part of a long-term process by which we’ll uncover the technologies for manufacturing life, in ways that could have very serious security and moral implications.       SHAFFER: Don’t bioethics pose a challenge to the idea that the best society is the most successful society? You argue in Our Posthuman Future that a society that genetically engineered its children to be more intelligent might be more productive and successful but wouldn’t be moral.     FUKUYAMA: I’ve got a simpler concern in my current book. It’s just that liberal democracy is not something you can take for granted, or that democracies will find a way to solve their problems. I think we’ve got a number of long-term problems in the United States that don’t seem to be getting addressed with the current political system.    Matthew Shaffer is a William F. Buckley Fellow at the National Review Institute        \fArticle 7.   Project Syndicate   Does Anything Matter?   Peter Singer      2011-06-13 – Can moral judgments be true or false? Or is ethics, at bottom, a purely subjective matter, for individuals to choose, or perhaps relative to the culture of the society in which one lives? We might have just found out the answer.   Among philosophers, the view that moral judgments state objective truths has been out of fashion since the 1930’s, when logical positivists asserted that, because there seems to be no way of verifying the truth of moral judgments, they cannot be anything other than expressions of our feelings or attitudes. So, for example, when we say, “You ought not to hit that child,” all we are really doing is expressing our disapproval of your hitting the child, or encouraging you to stop hitting the child. There is no truth to the matter of whether or not it is wrong for you to hit the child.   Although this view of ethics has often been challenged, many of the objections have come from religious thinkers who appealed to God’s commands. Such arguments have limited appeal in the largely secular world of Western philosophy. Other defenses of objective truth in ethics made no appeal to religion, but could make little headway against the prevailing philosophical mood.   Last month, however, saw a major philosophical event: the publication of Derek Parfit’s long-awaited book On What Matters. Until now, Parfit, who is Emeritus Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, had written only one book, Reasons and Persons, which appeared in 1984, to great acclaim. Parfit’s entirely secular arguments, and the comprehensive way in which he tackles alternative positions, have, for the first time in decades, put those who reject objectivism in ethics on the defensive.   On What Matters is a book of daunting length: two large volumes, totaling more than 1,400 pages, of densely argued text. But the core of the argument comes in the first 400 pages, which is not an insurmountable challenge for the intellectually curious – particularly given that Parfit, in the best tradition of English-language philosophy, always strives for lucidity, never using obscure words where simple ones will do. Each sentence is straightforward, the argument is clear, and Parfit often uses vivid examples to make his points. Thus, the book is an intellectual treat for anyone who wants to understand not so much “what matters” as whether anything really can matter, in an objective sense.   Many people assume that rationality is always instrumental: reason can tell us only how to get what we want, but our basic wants and desires are beyond the scope of reasoning. Not so, Parfit argues. Just as we can grasp the truth that 1 + 1 = 2, so we can see that I have a reason to avoid suffering agony at some future time, regardless of whether I now care about, or have desires about, whether I will suffer agony at that time. We can also have reasons (though not always conclusive reasons) to prevent others from suffering agony. Such self-evident normative truths provide the basis for Parfit’s defense of objectivity in ethics.   One major argument against objectivism in ethics is that people disagree deeply about right and wrong, and this disagreement extends to philosophers who cannot be accused of being ignorant or confused. If great thinkers like Immanuel Kant and Jeremy Bentham disagree about what we ought to do, can there really be an objectively true answer to that question?   Parfit’s response to this line of argument leads him to make a claim that is perhaps even bolder than his defense of objectivism in ethics. He considers three leading theories about what we ought to do – one deriving from Kant, one from the social-contract tradition of Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, and the contemporary philosophers John Rawls and T.M. Scanlon, and one from Bentham’s utilitarianism – and argues that the Kantian and social-contract theories must be revised in order to be defensible.   Then he argues that these revised theories coincide with a particular form of consequentialism, which is a theory in the same broad family as utilitarianism. If Parfit is right, there is much less disagreement between apparently conflicting moral theories than we all thought. The defenders of each of these theories are, in Parfit’s vivid phrase, “climbing the same mountain on different sides.”   Readers who go to On What Matters seeking an answer to the question posed by its title might be disappointed. Parfit’s real interest is in combating subjectivism and nihilism. Unless he can show that objectivism is true, he believes, nothing matters.   When Parfit does come to the question of “what matters,” his answer might seem surprisingly obvious. He tells us, for example, that what matters most now is that “we rich people give up some of our luxuries, ceasing to overheat the Earth’s atmosphere, and taking care of this planet in other ways, so that it continues to support intelligent life.”   Many of us had already reached that conclusion. What we gain from Parfit’s work is the possibility of defending these and other moral claims as objective truths.

I found him stern and humorless, sometimes even bitter. I have seen him since at international conferences and the like — never in the mood for small talk and exhibiting, sometimes in his glorious robes, not an ounce of Bedouin charm. Still, I was unprepared for the opinion column he published in Sunday’s Post. It read like a declaration of war.\n\n\nPrince Turki is not now in the government. Yet he is a member of the Saudi royal family and was once the kingdom’s intelligence chief and its former ambassador to both London and Washington. The man is solidly credentialed.\n\n\nHe is also angry as hell, and he lets America have it. He starts by citing what he calls President Obama’s “controversial speech last month, admonishing Arab governments to embrace democracy and provide freedom to their populations.” Saudi Arabia, he wrote, heard what Obama said and took it “seriously,” and he noted, of course, that Obama had not demanded the same rights for Palestinians under Israeli occupation. Point taken.\n\n\nBut the same kingdom that has taken Obama “seriously” is an absolute monarchy that, among other things, bans women from driving cars. It is also a country that offers no freedom of religion but offers, for the occasional criminal, a public beheading. Given that Turki has spent a good deal of time in the West, it’s not possible that he was unaware that commentators like me would be picky about the lack of basic freedoms. He doesn’t care.\n\n\nIndeed, that was the point. Turki — and by implication all of Saudi Arabia — has had it with the United States. The kingdom will not be lectured to. It is sick and tired of American favoritism to Israel — the exuberant congressional reception for Binyamin Netanyahu, for example — and the administration’s decision to oppose any effort in the United Nations to create a Palestinian state. In this matter, America is doing what Israel wants. \n\n\n“In September, the kingdom will use its considerable diplomatic might to support the Palestinians in their quest for international recognition,” Turki wrote. “American leaders have long called Israel an ‘indispensable’ ally. They will soon learn that there are other players in the region — not least the Arab street — who are as, if not more, ‘indispensable.’ The game of favoritism toward Israel has not proven wise for Washington, and soon it will be shown to be an even greater folly.”\n\n\nThis is not your usual diplomatic language — and even for Turki it is rough. It shows, though, a not-surprising frustration in the Arab world with American policy tethered for the moment to a quite stubborn and unimaginative Israeli policy. Both countries are suffering from a surfeit of democracy. Israel’s governing coalition is held hostage by the right; America’s governing coalition is in the same fix. \n\n\nTurki does not run out of wagging fingers. He says that those who think that the United States and Israel will determine the future of Palestine are dead wrong. “There will be disastrous consequences for U.S.-Saudi relations if the United States vetoes U.N. recognition of a Palestinian state. It would mark a nadir in the decades-long relationship as well as irrevocably damage the Israeli-Palestinian peace process and America’s reputation among Arab nations. The ideological distance between the Muslim world and the West in general would widen — and opportunities for friendship and cooperation between the two could vanish.” This from our ally, not to mention friendly gas station.\n\n\nThe tone of the column is both remarkable and ominous. It comes, as I said, from a man of little charm, but he is nevertheless a skilled diplomat and intelligence chief. While his vexation over the Palestinian problem is well-known, rarely has it been carried to this extent — and in such a public venue.\n\n\nA Post opinion column is designed to get the attention of the American government. I’m sure Prince Turki succeeded in that. But I hope he also got the attention of the Israeli government, which for some time now has enjoyed Saudi moderation on the Palestinian question. That seems about to change — not the least because the Arab street that Turki expressly mentioned is demanding it and the Saudis will, if they have to, appease the street. This is the gravamen of Prince Turki’s piece and is why he ends it so ominously for Israel: “I’d hate to be around when they face their comeuppance.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\fArticle 2.\n\n\nBoston Globe\n\n\nTurkey’s new challenges\n\n\nStephen Kinzer \n\n\n\n\n\nJune 14, 2011 -- SUNDAY’S ELECTION in Turkey was another reminder of the country’s astonishing rise, which has been one of the most dramatic geopolitical stories of the last decade. For the first 80 years of its existence as a nation, Turkey was dominated by generals and played almost no role in the world. Now it is a vibrant democracy and a major force in the Middle East, the Caucasus, North Africa, the Balkans, and beyond. The election was a triumph for Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has presided over his country’s remarkable transformation. His party won more votes than all other parties combined, making him the first Turkish prime minister in more than half a century to win three consecutive terms. He will naturally be tempted to take this victory as a mandate to charge ahead with his own projects. Instead he should do the opposite: curb his divisive rhetoric, adjust his authoritarian style, and seek broad support for projects that will strengthen Turkey and help calm the world’s most volatile region.\n\n\nSyrians who are racing toward Turkey in search of refuge represent Erdogan’s most immediate challenge. Turkey has become not just a safe haven, but a model for what many Arabs would like to see their countries become. This model — a government with roots in Islam but also committed to democracy, free enterprise, and good relations with Europe and the United States — represents the dream of millions of Tunisians, Libyans, Egyptians, Yemenis, Syrians, Jordanians, and Palestinians.\n\n\nFinding a way to stabilize the ever-more-turbulent Middle East is Turkey’s most urgent task. Erdogan is obsessed with his drive to make Turkey one of the world’s 10 biggest economies (it is now 17th). This will only be possible if the Middle East is peaceful and open for business.\n\n\nBesides dealing with upheaval in the Arab world, Turkey faces three other key foreign policy challenges. First is the continuing division of Cyprus between ethnic Greek and Turkish sectors. Second is the frozen conflict with Armenia, which seemed to be on the brink of resolution until Turkish and Armenian nationalists killed a promising agreement reached by both countries two years ago. Erdogan’s new mandate gives him the power to overrule militants in his ranks. If he does, and if Armenian leaders can do the same, the entire region will benefit.\n\n\nThird is to rebuild relations with Israel. Erdogan has become a hero in the Middle East for his forthright denunciations of Israel’s occupation of the West Bank and its blockade of Gaza. Like many Turks, he is still enraged over the murder of nine Turkish civilians by Israeli commandos who stormed a freighter bearing relief supplies for Gaza last year. His anger may be justified by the facts, but he should realize that a resumption of Turkey’s good ties to Israel could be a decisive step toward Middle East peace.\n\n\nForeign policy challenges are only part of Erdogan’s post-election agenda. He also needs to deepen Turkish democracy. That would require resolving the decades-old Kurdish conflict and taking concrete steps to reassure secular Turks that their country is not moving toward religious rule.\n\n\nTurkey’s grand project in the next couple of years will be writing a new constitution to replace the one imposed by generals three decades ago. Erdogan wants to replace the current parliamentary system with one built around a strong president and then run for the presidency himself. His party did not win enough seats in Parliament to impose a constitution on its own, so if he wants to make such a radical change, he will have to propose a constitution that represents a national consensus. That can only be reached if the constitution includes strong guarantees of free speech, rights for women, judicial independence, and cultural freedom for all ethnic and religious groups.\n\n\nSuch a constitution would embody the wishes of most Turks. It might also reinvigorate Turkey’s stalled campaign to join the European Union. If Turkey becomes an EU member by the time it celebrates its 100th anniversary in 2023, that would be Erdogan’s eternal legacy.\n\n\nTurkey is poised to become one of the most successful countries of the 21st century, a model of Muslim democracy and a powerful force for regional peace. Whether it will fulfill its potential depends largely on how Erdogan handles the mandate he has just won.\n\n\n\n\n\nStephen Kinzer teaches international relations at Boston University and is author of “Reset: Iran, Turkey, and America’s Future.’’\n\n\n\n\fArticle 3.\n\n\nThe Financial Times \n\n\nWhy Syria will get away with it\n\n\nGideon Rachman\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 13 2011 --  late last week, Robert Gates, the US defence secretary, launched an offensive of his own. In a speech in Brussels, he dismissed most of America’s European allies as a useless bunch of timewasters. I paraphrase  but not much. \n\n\nMr Gates pointed out that while all Nato countries had voted to intervene in Libya, most had chosen not to participate in the actual fighting. Even those European countries that are taking part began to run short of munitions just 11 weeks into the fighting – forcing an exasperated America to step into the breach. More broadly, a situation in which the US accounts for 75 per cent of the military spending in Nato was “unacceptable” and unsustainable. If it is not rectified, Mr Gates predicted, Nato faces a “dismal” future.\n\n\nThe conjunction of the Gates speech and the Syrian civil war is very telling. It explains why a 20-year experiment with the idea that western military force can put the world to rights is coming to a close. \n\n\nJust a few weeks ago, that would have seemed a surprising conclusion. Supporters of “liberal interventionism” hailed the decision to bomb Colonel Gaddafis forces in Libya as evidence of a longed-for new era, in which dictators can no longer feel free to massacre their own people. \n\n\nHowever a western failure to intervene, as the Syrian army brutalises and kills its own citizens, is likely to be a more accurate guide to the future than the Libyan campaign. There is, of course, a direct link between the west’s reluctance to get involved in Syria and the frustrating and (so far) inconclusive nature of the Libyan intervention. \n\n\nHowever, the Syrian conflict also needs to be seen in the context of a generation-long experiment with liberal interventionism. That era began in 1991, when the collapse of the Soviet Union left the US as the world’s sole superpower and a swift victory in the first Gulf war restored confidence in the power and effectiveness of American military might. Since then, the debate about how and when to use military power has waxed and waned. Western governments chastised themselves over the failure to protect the Kurds and the Shia in Iraq in 1991, over the Rwandan genocide of 1994 and over the many years of dithering as lives were lost in the Balkans. But a series of apparently successful interventions – Bosnia, Kosovo, East Timor, Sierra Leone – gradually strengthened the belief that western military power could be used to end conflicts and save civilians.\n\n\nThe bitter experiences of the Afghan and Iraq wars, however, shifted the debate on military intervention once more. Both Barack Obama in the US and David Cameron in Britain promised to be leaders who would adopt a much more cautious attitude to foreign military adventures. Then along came the Arab spring and western leaders once again found themselves committing to military action, this time in Libya – Mr Obama with evident reluctance, Mr Cameron and President Nicolas Sarkozy of France with apparent enthusiasm.\n\n\nThe Libyan war illustrates how unfolding events can force a political leader’s hand. That could still happen in Syria. But it seems much more likely that, this time, the west will stand aside. \n\n\nIn part, this is because of deadlock at the UN, where Russia and China  angry about the Libyan war  are blocking efforts to pass a resolution that even condemns events in Syria, let alone prepares the ground for intervention. However the broader context is the west’s diminishing ability and willingness to intervene at all.\n\n\nThe Gates speech effectively marks the end of the American ambition to turn Nato into the global, military arm of a unified western world. The Americans have flirted with this idea, ever since the onset of the “war on terror”. But, as the Afghan war has worn on, so the military effort has become more and more heavily dependent on the US. \n\n\nThe fact that Europeans called for a campaign in Libya that they are incapable of conducting alone has merely re-enforced the American view that the European arm of Nato is, to varying degrees, feckless and unreliable. Disarray and recriminations within Nato hobble the single most effective potential tool for western military intervention overseas.\n\n\nEven more significant in the long run is the American anxiety that budgetary constraints, which are leading to defence cuts in Europe, are beginning to be replicated in the US itself. Admiral Michael Mullen, America’s top military officer, has called the budget deficit the single biggest threat to US national security. It is also the single biggest constraint on future bouts of “liberal interventionism”.\n\n\nMoney is not the only problem, however. Over the past 20 years it has become apparent that swiftly agreed-upon military actions can lead to entanglements that last for many years. There is still a Nato mission in Kosovo and an EU military mission in Bosnia, more than a decade after the fighting ended in both places. \n\n\nAs for Afghanistan – that conflict has now lasted almost twice as long as the second world war. Western governments are also only beginning to come to terms with what may soon be required in Libya. Against this background, there are very few takers for yet another military venture – this time in Syria.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\fArticle 4.\n\n\nThe American Interest\n\n\nThe Conservative Revolutionary\n\n\nWalter Russell Mead \n\n\n\n\n\nJune 12, 2011 -- The United States is the most revolutionary power in the history of the world, but after more than 200 years of a brilliant revolutionary career we are still not very good at understanding or responding to the revolutions our example, our ideas, our economy and our technology do so much to create.\n\n\nThe Arab spring is the latest example of the clash between America’s revolutionary world role and our pathetic cluelessness about the forces we do so much to promote.  The Arab Spring is turning into a long, hot summer.  Civil wars in Libya, Syria and Yemen and the sullen silence of the Shi’a in Bahrain have baptized Arab democracy in blood.  More will flow — and American foreign policy is befuddled and bemused.\n\n\nNone of the experts look particularly smart at the moment.  The ‘realists’ who counseled President Obama to forget George W. Bush’s support of Middle Eastern democracy and cultivate our relations with regional despots like Hosni Mubarak, the Iranian mullahs and the younger Assad have been sent back to the benches in disgrace.  Their counsel is now seen as both morally dubious and pragmatically unwise; the ‘realists’ would have put the US on the wrong side of history in the service of unrealistic assumptions about the stability of despotic regimes.\n\n\nBut the idealists who seek to replace them already have egg on their faces.  “Days, not weeks” is what they promised the President when he began to bomb for democracy in Libya.  The democratic revolution in Egypt is looking less democratic by the day; it looks more and more as if the Army used public unrest to block the Mubarak family’s attempt to turn Egypt into a family possession.  The Army has ruled Egypt since the overthrow of King Farouk, playing liberals and religious conservatives off against each other.  It looks set to go on doing that for some time to come.  In Yemen, Bahrain and Syria, the counsel of the idealists seems dark and confused.  US policy overall seems to have found the ‘sour spot’ that is the particular curse of the Obama administration: too friendly to the revolt to earn the trust and gratitude of the despots, too cautious and compromising to win many friends on the street.\n\n\nOverall I am more cautious than optimistic about where the Arab Spring is headed.  There is little prospect for the kind of rapid economic growth that could improve the prospects for young unemployed and underemployed Arabs.  Foreign investment and tourism have already been badly hit by the unrest of the last six months, and the Arab regimes are turning to aid donors and organizations like the IMF and the World Bank in increasing desperation.\n\n\nCulturally, many of the necessary preconditions are not in place.  The poor quality of most Arab universities, the limited access to serious political history and discourse among all but a handful of Arab intellectuals, the suppression of political life under past dictatorships, the weakness of Islamic political thought in recent centuries and the absence of a robust and deeply rooted tradition of Islamic democracy all work against the rapid widespread development of stable liberal democracy in the Arab world.\n\n\nPutting the dark economic outlook together with the problematic cultural and political situation makes optimism a tough position to hold.  Without in any way scanting or minimizing the idealism, dedication and vision of the democrats rising in the Arab world today, they still seem a long way from winning.  They remind me still of the Marquis de Lafayette during the French Revolution: they believe in all the right ideas, but their countries aren’t ready for the vision they seek to promote.  They can help make a revolution but others will, for a time at least, determine the flow of events.\n\n\nIf true, then both the realists and the idealists are wrong about the Arab Revolution.  The realists are wrong that despotic regimes can provide long term stability in the region; the idealists are wrong that the fall of the old despots will lead to liberal democratic states.\n\n\nAmericans have been getting foreign revolutions wrong for more than 200 years.  It began with the French Revolution.  Enthusiasts like Thomas Jefferson initially thought they saw France following in America’s footsteps.  Then came the Reign of Terror, Napoleon, and a generation of brutal war.\n\n\nMany Americans responded with the same generous enthusiasm to the South American revolutions against colonial rule.  Once again, those revolutions failed to establish anything like liberal democratic rule.\n\n\nThe cycles of revolution — 1830, 1848, 1917-20, 1946-1960 (decolonization), 1989-91, 2003-5 and now 2011 — catch Americans flatfooted over and over again.  We are surprised when they occur, and we are surprised when they fail to follow the course we expect.\n\n\nDelusional Realists\n\n\nThe realists are half right: most revolutions will not bring about stable democratic societies.  But realists get the other half wrong; revolution is a basic fact of modern life and the kind of ‘stability’ that old fashioned diplomats long for is just a mirage.  American foreign policy cannot proceed on the assumption that despotic, frozen regimes will last.  They won’t.  Sooner or later they will come crashing down — and as the pace of technological and social change around the world continues to accelerate, such revolutionary upheavals are likely to become more frequent.\n\n\nThere is another problem with realism.  Like it or not, the United States is a revolutionary power.  Whether our government is trying to overthrow foreign dictators is almost irrelevant; American society is the most revolutionary force on the planet.  The Internet is more subversive than the CIA in its prime.  The dynamism of American society is constantly creating new businesses, new technologies, new ideas and new social models.  These innovations travel, and they make trouble when they do.  Saudi conservatives know that whatever geopolitical arrangements the Saudi princes make with the American government, the American people are busily undermining the core principles of Saudi society.  It’s not just our NGOs educating Saudi women and civil society activists; it’s not just the impact of American college life on the rising generation of the Saudi elite.  We change the world even when we aren’t thinking anything about global revolution — when Hollywood and rap musicians are just trying to make a buck, they are stoking the fires of change around the world.\n\n\nA revolutionary nation cannot make a conservative foreign policy work for long.  In the 1820s and 1830s Washington tried to reassure the Mexican government that it had no hostile designs against Mexican territory.  But the American people were moving into Texas and the US government couldn’t stop that movement or blunt the threat to Mexico if it tried.  In the same way today, the economic and political activity of individual Americans and American companies is changing the world in ways that make life much harder for governments in countries like Russia, China and Saudi Arabia.  We can press all the reset buttons with Russia that we want, but the Russian government will still notice that both US society and sometimes the government are actively working to help foreign subversives overthrow repressive regimes.\n\n\nFeckless Idealists\n\n\nIf the desire of our realists to conduct foreign policy with foreign despots as if unprincipled cooperation with the bad guys could build a stable world is unrealistic, the idealism of our enthusiasts that every new foreign revolution will bring a millennium of democratic peace is absurd.\n\n\nAmerican foreign policy cannot expect that revolutions in foreign countries will rescue us from the painful dilemmas our foreign policy often confronts. Revolution is not the deus ex machina that will make the world peaceful; it is a tsunami that sweeps everything before it, and often leaves the world messier and more dangerous.\n\n\nModern history teaches two great lessons about revolution: that revolutions are inevitable, and that a large majority of revolutions either fail or go bad.  Americans almost instinctively look at revolutions in terms of our own past: the 1688 Glorious Revolution that made Parliament more powerful than the King in  England, and the American Revolution that led in relatively short order to the establishment of a stable and constitutional government.\n\n\nMost revolutions don’t work like this at all.  Many of them fail, with the old despots crushing dissent or making only cosmetic changes to the old system.  (This happened in Austria in 1848 and something very like it may be happening in Egypt today.)  Others move into radicalism, terror and mob rule before a new despot comes along to bring order — at least until the next futile and bloody revolutionary spasm.  That was France’s history for almost 100 years after the storming of the Bastille.  China, Russia and Iran all saw revolutions like this in the 20th century.\n\n\nThe revolutions that ‘work’ are the exceptions, not the rule.  The peaceful revolutions in the Central European countries as Soviet power melted in 1989-1990 are a unique exception to the rule that most revolutions either turn nasty or fail.  When many American idealists think about revolution today, they have Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary in mind.\n\n\nFew assumptions can lead you into as much trouble this quickly.  Even in 1989-90, those countries were the exception and not the rule.  Think Ukraine, Belarus, Yugoslavia, Romania, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and of course Russia itself.  More people live in countries where the 1989-90 revolutionary wave failed to establish secure constitutional democracy than live in those where it succeeded.\n\n\nMore, the countries that had ‘velvet’ revolutions shared a number of important characteristics.  They had or longed to have close political and cultural ties to the West.  They wanted to join NATO and the EU, and had a reasonable confidence of doing so sooner rather than later.  They could expect enormous amounts of aid and foreign direct investment if they continued along the path of democratic reform.  They lay on the ‘western’ side of the ancient division of Europe between the Orthodox east and the Catholic/Protestant homeland of the modern liberal tradition.\n\n\nNo Arab country looks anything like this.  Indeed, most seem closer to Yugoslavia and Belarus or, at best, Ukraine.  We, and they, may get lucky, and the revolutions in the Arab world may lead to something that looks more like Central Europe than like Central Asia.  That would be a nice surprise, but we should not be placing large bets that this will actually happen.\n\n\nChina, by the way, does not look very much like the Czech Republic.  Revolution there is very unlikely to produce a US or European style democracy anytime soon.\n\n\nIf realists ignore the inevitability of revolution, idealists close their eyes to the problems of revolutionary upheavals in societies that have difficult histories, deep social divisions, and poor short term economic prospects.  Unfortunately the countries most likely to experience revolutions are usually the countries that lack the preconditions for Anglo-American style relatively peaceful revolutions that end with the establishment of stable constitutional order.  If things were going well in those countries, they would not be having revolutions.\n\n\nHistorically, revolutions in foreign countries are both necessary for their political development and inevitable.  They often tend to make American foreign policy more difficult — and the world more dangerous.  On the evidence so far, this is the pattern we are seeing in the Middle East today.\n\n\nRevolutionary Realism?\n\n\nThe difficulty American policymakers have in coming to grips with the recurring phenomenon of foreign revolutions is rooted in America’s paradoxical world role.  We are not just the world’s leading revolutionary nation; we are also the chief custodian of the international status quo.  We are upholding the existing balance of power and the international system of finance and trade with one hand, but the American agenda in the world ultimately aims to transform rather than to defend.\n\n\nIt is harder to be an effective revolutionary power than to be a conservative one — and it is harder still to combine the two roles.\n\n\nA traditional conservative power knows what it wants.  Revolutionary powers have a tougher job; building the future is harder work than holding on to the past.  This is particularly true in the American case; the global transformation we seek is unparalleled for depth, complexity and scale.\n\n\nWe are not sure how this revolutionary transformation works.  We know that it involves liberal political change: governments of law rather than of men and legitimacy derived from the consent of the governed as measured in regular and free elections.  We also know that involves intellectual and social change: traditional religious ideas must make room for the equality of the sexes and the rights of religious minorities.  Property rights must be rooted in law and protected by an independent judicial system.  While governments have a role in the economy, the mechanisms of the market must ultimately be allowed to work their way.\n\n\nWe do not agree among ourselves about the proper sequence of these changes.  We know that in the short run, democratic voting procedures may not produce liberal governments.  We know that demagogues and aspiring despots can use the language and even the mechanisms of democracy to build personal dictatorships (Napoleon III and Hugo Chavez, for example).  We know that popular opinion is sometimes more nationalistic than elite opinion and that gains for democracy do not always lead to more foreign policy cooperation.  In most cases, progress toward stable and peaceful democratic government comes slowly if it comes at all; even if you believe in ‘democratic peace theory, hoping that the democratization of other countries will solve American foreign policy problems is a fool’s game.\n\n\nYet we also know — or at least we believe — that in the long run a more democratic world is a better if not always a safer world, and that it would be immoral as well as impractical to stand in the way of the changes that need to come.\n\n\nIf we add the conservative mission of the United States to the revolutionary agenda, the problems of American foreign policy become more complex still.  We are trying to carry out a vast reordering of global society even as we preserve the stability of the international political order: we are trying to walk blindfolded on a tightrope across Niagara Falls — while changing our clothes.\n\n\nThe uncertainties and risks that surround us should not be underestimated.  There has never been a worldwide revolution of this kind before; nobody knows for sure how best to speed the plow.  Nobody has ever had to balance transformational and conservative roles on a global scale before.\n\n\nFrom an American point of view, the Arab Spring is just another complication of this global task — a sudden thunderstorm with flashes of lightening, driving rain and unpredictable gusts of wind as we hop one-legged on the tightrope changing our pants.  The Islamic world is entering new territory as it struggles to integrate religious and liberal political values; as the United States tries to juggle its geopolitical interests with its values at a volatile moment in world history, we are almost certain to get the balance wrong much of the time.\n\n\nHere, however, history offers some hope.  As I wrote at the beginning of this post, the United States has been doing two things for more than 200 years: getting foreign revolutions wrong, but somehow still pushing its global revolution forward.  America’s success as a conservative revolutionary power on a global scale depends less on the clever policies of our presidents and our secretaries of state, and more on the creativity and dynamism of American society as a whole.\n\n\nIt is power of a free people more than the brilliance of our intellectual and social establishment that has brought the United States this far; in that truth lies the secret of our revolution and of our success.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\fArticle 5.\n\n\nNYT\n\n\nIran Without Nukes\n\n\nRoger Cohen\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 13, 2011 — Remember Iran? \n\n\nI do. It’s been two years since the Iranian people rose up to protest a stolen election with a bravery that stirred the world and presented Americans with a truer image of a young and highly educated nation than the old specter of the bearded Islamic zealot. The Green Movement was suppressed through barbaric violence but its example helped kindle the Arab Spring. \n\n\nAs Hamid Dabashi of Columbia University wrote in July, 2009: “Tehran, I believe, is ground zero of a civil rights movement that will leave no Muslim or Arab country, or even Israel, untouched.” He added, “The moving pictures of Iranians flooding colorfully into the streets have forever altered the visual vocabulary of the global perception of ‘the Middle East.”’ \n\n\nSeldom were there more prescient words. \n\n\nThey were quoted by Nader Hashemi of the University of Denver in a recent talk on Iran, in which he noted shared Iranian and Arab aims: “Democracy and dignity, the rule of law and respect for basic human rights, political transparency and an end to corruption.” \n\n\nThat urge is still powerful in Iran beneath the opaque, directionless apparatus of the Islamic Republic. Iran is weak now, its ideology as tired as Osama Bin Laden’s, as marginal to peoples questing to reconcile their Muslim faith and modernity in new ways. \n\n\nI would probe this weakness through new approaches. But we are stuck still with the world’s most paranoid relationship: the American-Iranian relationship. That’s largely because there’s another way to remember Iran — as the Godot of nuclear threats, the country always on the verge of producing a nuclear weapon or acquiring the “breakout capacity” to make one, but never, despite the dire warning of Israeli leaders dating back to the 1990s, doing either, preferring to dwell in the Islamic Republic’s favored zones: ambivalence and inertia. As one awaits this tortuous Godot, one might recall a forecast of a bomb by 1999 (Shimon Peres) or 2004 (Ehud Barak), or Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s talk of “a messianic apocalyptic cult controlling atomic bombs,” or my friend Jeffrey Goldberg’s allusion in The Atlantic last year to a “consensus” that there is “a better than 50 percent chance that Israel will launch a strike by next July.” That would be next month. \n\n\nIt might also be worth recalling that Meir Dagan, the former head of Israel’s Mossad spy agency, declared last month that attacking Iran would be “a stupid idea.” He suggested his main worry was not Iran itself but Netanyahu’s susceptibility to “dangerous adventure.” \n\n\nDagan’s concerns have surfaced as Seymour Hersh concludes in a New Yorker article this month that, as he put it in one interview, “There’s just no serious evidence inside that Iran is actually doing anything to make a nuclear weapon.” \n\n\nHis reporting reveals that the U.S. National Intelligence Estimate (N.I.E.) of 2007 — which concluded “with high confidence” that Iran had halted a nuclear-weapons program in 2003 — still pertains in the classified N.I.E. of 2011. As a retired senior intelligence official put it to Hersh, there’s nothing “substantially new” that “leads to a bomb.” \n\n\nIn other words, Iran, epicenter of inefficiency, unable to produce a kilowatt of electricity through its Bushehr nuclear reactor despite decades of effort, is still doing its old brinkmanship number. \n\n\nRemember, Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader, is the guardian of the revolution. That is a conservative business. Breakout, let alone a bomb, is a bridge too far if the Islamic Republic is what you’ve vowed to preserve. Much better to gain leverage by producing low-enriched uranium — far from weapons grade — under International Atomic Energy Agency inspection and allow rumors to swirl. \n\n\nSo Iran, long at the top of the Washington agenda, has slid down. It’s partly the Arab Spring. It’s partly that you can’t keep saying the same thing. People do begin to remember the refrain, although nobody in the large Iran-the-clear-and-present-danger school ever seems to get called to account. They should be. The nuclear bogeyman obsession has been a distraction from the need to try to tease out a relationship with Tehran, see Iran as it is. Only the most flimsy efforts have been made, insufficient to test the waters. \n\n\nThose waters are troubled. The Islamic Republic has not recovered from its convulsion of 2009. It is sickly, consumed by hypocrisy as it cheers on some brave Arabs (but not those in Syria) while brutalizing its own seekers of the freedom promised in 1979. Arabs aren’t buying Iranian hypocrisy. Only Iran’s command of Revolutionary Guard force and the opposition’s lack of a shared goal salvage it. \n\n\nKhamenei is at loggerheads with President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who got into such a sulk recently that he took 11 days off work, infuriating everybody. The Majlis, or parliament, is investigating Ahmadinejad for various alleged frauds including, of all things, vote-buying in 2009! Ahmadinejad was booed during his June 3 speech commemorating Ayatollah Khomeini’s death. Iran is characterized by what Farideh Farhi of the University of Hawaii recently termed “administrative chaos.” \n\n\nThat’s not how you make a nuke. When remembering Iran — and it must be remembered — call the fear-mongers to account. \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\fArticle 6.\n\n\nNATIONAL REVIEW\n\n\nInterview with - Francis Fukuyama:  The Difficulty of Political Order\n\n\nMatthew Shaffer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMATTHEW SHAFFER: Origins is a historical work, as opposed to previous works, such as The End of History, and Our Posthuman Future, which were more theoretical. What, for you, is the prescriptive value of history?\n\n\n\nFRANCIS FUKUYAMA: This really started with a practical concern I had after dealing with failed states and nation-building issues in the wake of September 11 and our nation-building efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq. It seemed to me that the United States in particular didn’t appreciate the difficulty of this kind of activity, because we didn’t adequately understand how hard it was to establish institutions. When I was at Johns Hopkins at SAIS [School of Advanced International Studies] I ran an international-development program, focusing on issues of anti-corruption and improving governance. And a lot of it seemed premised on an overly optimistic faith in the ability of outsiders to effect desired outcomes. So I decided to write a book about where institutions came from in countries that had them and could take them for granted. We’ve forgotten a lot of that history and how we’ve gotten to the present. Along the way it was also a means of revisiting a lot of The End of History 20 years later.\n \n\n\n\n\nSHAFFER: Some theorists, like Hegel, think that history doesn’t just tell us what is stable, or what works, but actually points us toward moral progress. Do you believe that?\n\n\n\n\nFUKUYAMA: Fundamentally, I believe in liberal democracy, that it’s the best form of government, and that the world has made moral progress. But that’s a separate question from whether the development of democratic institutions is inevitable and driven by an underlying historical force. I’ve become more skeptical of that latter belief over the years as I’ve become more attentive to the role of accident and contingency. And my current book is about a lot of that. For example: The reason we got to democracy in Europe is the almost accidental survival of a feudal institution — the English parliament — into the modern period. That’s something that didn’t happen in other European countries, and which we therefore can’t take for granted. So, as you see, the normative concern is separate from the empirical question of whether democracy is inevitable.\n \n\n\n\n\nSHAFFER: Origins incorporates economics, anthropology, philosophy, and social psychology, for lessons about political order. Is that kind of study too rare today?\n\n\n\n\nFUKUYAMA: This is partly the fault of the structure of academia. There’s such a premium placed on specialization and narrowness that it’s very hard to think more broadly and to cross disciplinary boundaries. I work at Stanford in an interdisciplinary institute, and I’ve been associated with these kinds of outfits for most of my years. And those are where the most interesting research gets done.\n \n\n\n\n\nSHAFFER: What field outside of political science has the most important insights for understanding political order?\n\n\n\n\nFUKUYAMA: That’s hard to say. I don’t know if there is one. Part of the problem is economics — it’s a very important discipline, but in a way it’s colonized the rest of the social sciences. A lot of political analysis in academia is driven by this model of everybody being a rational decision maker driven by more or less material interests. There’s obviously something to that, but it’s a very limited way of looking about politics, which is about dignity and values and ideas that can’t be explained in material terms. Other disciplines — sociology and anthropology — have gotten at those things better than economics has.\n \n\n\n\n\nSHAFFER: Your chapter “How Christianity Undermines the Family” is provocatively titled and sort of microcosmic for your whole thesis. Can you tell us about it?\n\n\n\n\nFUKUYAMA: You can’t have modern politics if society is based on the biological principles of supporting friends and family. That’s the natural mode of human sociability. We’re naturally inclined to take care of family and exchange favors with friends. Human beings will interact in that manner without anyone telling them to behave that way because it’s biologically grounded.\n\n\n\n\nIn all human societies, social order at one stage depended on extended kinship — people living in tribes where people traced ancestry to a common ancestor that may be three, four, or five generations dead. This was no less true of Europeans than it was of the Chinese, or Arabs, or Africans, or anyone else in the world. All the Germanic barbarians organized themselves tribally after overrunning the Roman Empire.\n\nOne of the broad questions I’ve addressed in the book is how did these different societies make an exit out of kinship-based social organization into a modern-based state, with impersonal, centralized administration? Europe in that respect was quite exceptional, because that happened early, and it happened through the agency of the Catholic Church, which changed the rules of inheritance for kin-groups. It forbade divorce, it forbade concubinage, and it forbade cousin marriages within three or four degrees of relatedness. All of these were practices in tribal societies that kept property within an extended kin-group. In the Arab world in many places they still encourage cross-cousin marriage, where you marry your first cousin and the two families get to keep property within this narrow circle.\n\n\n\n\nWhen the Catholic Church [forbade cousin marriage] in the eighth century, it wasn’t thinking about the effect on kinship. It was acting in a self-interested way, because by cutting off these ways of kin-groups’ keeping property, the Church ended up being the beneficiary. So if a woman didn’t marry and didn’t have children but had a big estate, she tended to donate it to the Church. So the Church helped effect in Europe the breakdown of extended kinship very, very early. Even in the beginning of the Middle Ages, people owned property as individuals. Women could hold property — they could sell it, alienate it, in ways that they still can’t in parts of the Arab world. And this meant that individualism became very deeply rooted in European society. So some individualism was already established by the time Europe got to feudalism. And feudalism is basically a contract — it’s one that is very hierarchical, between a stronger and weaker person, but it is a contract between two people.\n\n\n\n\nSo the idea of exchange and private property dates way, way back, hundreds of years before the Enlightenment, Reformation, etc. So I think that the basis for European modernization traces all the way back to developments like that. In China, in India, the exit out of kinship was accomplished through political power, via a state that tried to create impersonal government layered on top of a kin-based society. And those kin-groups really never went away. Even in contemporary China and India, in certain parts there are still kin-groups that influence politics.\n \n\n\n\n\nSHAFFER: But China had an impersonal government — a meritocratic bureaucracy — without Christianity, and long before the West did, yes?\n\n\n\n\nFUKUYAMA: So you have to understand what that means. China didn’t create the first state, it created the first modern state, meaning a state which recruited people into a centralized bureaucracy based on talent and merit, essentially, and not based on family relations, or connections to the household of the emperor, or something of that sort. So it had a modern form of public administration. And this was all consolidated by the third century B.C. But what the country never got to was the rule of law. Up to the modern day, the concept of a sovereign being limited by the rule of law never existed. So what that meant is that at a very early period in their history, the Chinese perfected strong, absolutist government. And that’s been a consistent pattern — high-quality, authoritarian government. And I think that continues up to the present.\n \n\n\n\n\nSHAFFER: Could we trace Western ascendance to that one factor, the rule of law?\n\n\n\n\nFUKUYAMA: That’s what’s interesting about the present period. A lot of economic theory says you can’t have modern economic growth without Western-style rule of law. Economists who believe this are thinking about two critical things — property rights and contract enforcement. And there’s a lot of theory and a lot of empirical evidence that show that these are in fact important. The problem with that theory is that it doesn’t really square with the facts in contemporary China. As everybody knows, for the past three decades, China has been growing at double-digit rates and they don’t have Western rule of law.\n\n\n\n\nI think you can rescue the theory in the long run, because without rule of law they can’t keep this up. In a way the challenge that contemporary China poses it that they are doing well, and in the short run they’re doing better than the United States without having these Western institutions. The real challenge is the long-run sustainability of that system, or of the two systems. And looking at that in the long-run, I would still bet on the West, with its rule of law and systems of checks and balances on authority.\n\n\n\n\nSHAFFER: You’ve probably heard a lot of phony rebuttals based on misreading of The End of History. So, I won’t attempt one — but you’ve made oblique references to your own revisions and criticisms. How does the rise of China and the current Arab unrest, for example, fit into the end of history?\n\n\n\n\nFUKUYAMA: If you understand the original thesis correctly, what I was saying is that there was a theory of history among progressive intellectuals for most of the 20th century. That theory of history was Marxism. And according to the Marxists, the end of history was a communist utopia. My observation in the late 1980s is that we weren’t going to get there. Liberal democracies seemed to be the highest stage of political development, and I didn’t see any real alternatives. If you understand the thesis that way, I still believe that. Nothing that’s happened in the last 20 years has convinced me that there’s a higher form of government. Certainly not 9/11 — I don’t think anybody wants to live in a place like Iran and Afghanistan, so I don’t think that’s a serious competitor. China is a more plausible alternative. But I don’t think that anybody who’s not culturally Chinese would duplicate their system, and the Chinese are not really proselytizing their system. So I still think liberal democracy is the default form of government.\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s changed for me are a couple of things: One is the idea of political decay. It wasn’t an important part of the End of History. But I do think that all political systems, including liberal democracies, can decay over time. They can get too rigid, they can fail to adapt, and if they do, then they’re going to get into trouble, just like authoritarian systems. The other issue, which we’ve already touched on, is contingency in history. So the route to getting into modernity is, I now think, full of a lot of accident, and so it’s not as if there’s this inevitable historical process that driving us toward the present. I think it should make us both more appreciative of the fact that we’ve gotten to the present and also more aware of the fragility of modern institutions.\n \n\n\n\n\nSHAFFER: A lot of people have related that — your focus on the contingency of political order, and our ability to construct democracies — to your “falling-out” with neoconservatism. Was that “falling out” just local to some of the failures and disappointments of the Bush years or was it a break with the intellectual project as a whole?\n\n\n\n\nFUKUYAMA: It was more a practical dispute over methods. I didn’t think U.S. hard power was an effective method [for advancing liberal democracy], and the Bush administration hadn’t really thought through the implications of invading Iraq. I still think there are ways that the United States can help promote democracy, but it’s a slow and long-term process. For example, I’m on the board of the National Endowment for Democracy, which had an important role in supporting solidarity in Poland in the 1980s, and in Serbia, and the Orange Coalition in Ukraine. So there are ways in which we’ve encouraged democratic forces around the world. I still believe in that mission and project. But I don’t think the Bush administration actually invaded Iraq to promote democracy. They had security objectives in mind, and they added the democracy argument as an afterthought, and that’s what stuck in people’s minds. That was a mistake, because it kind of undermined the notion of democracy promotion, simply because it was connected to a very unpopular intervention.\n\n\n\n\nSHAFFER: Taking lessons from that, what can we do to promote democracy in the aftermath of the “Arab Spring”?\n\n\n\n\nFUKUYAMA: We already are doing a lot. We’ve got organizations like the National Democratic Institute, or the International Republican Institute, that are all over Tunisia and Egypt and Libya, and other places, trying to help them organize political parties, trade unions, civil-society organizations, that hopefully will allow the more Western-oriented democrats in those Arab countries to actually contest in the elections. As we move toward votes in Tunisia and Egypt we want to have some alternative to the Muslim Brotherhood and the military. So we’re giving them that kind of assistance right now. That’s difficult, because they haven’t had experience with democracy previously.\n\n\n\n\nIt’s a long-term struggle, and I think we’ll be disappointed in the short run. I don’t think the more pro-Western forces are the ones that will end up on top in the short-run. But we’ve got to start somewhere.\n\n\n\n\nSHAFFER: Is the spread of liberal democracy dependent upon persisting American hegemony?\n\n\n\n\nFUKUYAMA: It’s been helpful. The U.S. obviously plays a big role in maintaining a liberal, open world order, through its alliances and the influence it projects. And American ideas have been very dominant in the world especially in the last two decades. A lot of that is shifting now because of the rise of other powers and other ideas. But the idea of liberal democracy — the U.S. is not the only exemplar of liberal democracy — [remains]. It’s a powerful idea that would exist independently of whether the U.S. is hegemonic or not.\n\n\n\n\nI’m not as scared of a world without American hegemony as some people are. We went through the whole Cold War period in which the U.S. was one of two superpowers. A return to a more multi-polar world in certain ways induces a fair amount of moderation among big players in the system, because people know they can’t get their way unilaterally. And in the more multi-polar world we’d probably think twice about doing things like Iraq. The more important question is: In the global marketplace of ideas, how dominant will American ideas about freedom and rule of law and democracy and our economic model be? Our ideas will obviously be challenged; and it’s important for the U.S. to put its own house in order, both politically and economically, because that’s the most important way we exercise influence around the world: The model we set.\n \n\n\n\n\nSHAFFER: To revisit Our Posthuman Future, are there any developments in bio-technologies in the past nine years that you find particularly disturbing?\n\n\n\n\nFUKUYAMA: Yes. The whole rise of synthetic biology, where we’ve had new forms of life, and the ability to do new forms of life is proceeding extremely rapidly. The creation of an artificial bacteria itself is not immediately threatening, but it’s part of a long-term process by which we’ll uncover the technologies for manufacturing life, in ways that could have very serious security and moral implications.\n \n\n\n\n\nSHAFFER: Don’t bioethics pose a challenge to the idea that the best society is the most successful society? You argue in Our Posthuman Future that a society that genetically engineered its children to be more intelligent might be more productive and successful but wouldn’t be moral.\n\n\n\n\nFUKUYAMA: I’ve got a simpler concern in my current book. It’s just that liberal democracy is not something you can take for granted, or that democracies will find a way to solve their problems. I think we’ve got a number of long-term problems in the United States that don’t seem to be getting addressed with the current political system.\n\n\n\nMatthew Shaffer is a William F. Buckley Fellow at the National Review Institute\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\fArticle 7.\n\n\nProject Syndicate\n\n\nDoes Anything Matter?\n\n\nPeter Singer\n\n\n\n\n\n2011-06-13 – Can moral judgments be true or false? Or is ethics, at bottom, a purely subjective matter, for individuals to choose, or perhaps relative to the culture of the society in which one lives? We might have just found out the answer.\n\n\nAmong philosophers, the view that moral judgments state objective truths has been out of fashion since the 1930’s, when logical positivists asserted that, because there seems to be no way of verifying the truth of moral judgments, they cannot be anything other than expressions of our feelings or attitudes. So, for example, when we say, “You ought not to hit that child,” all we are really doing is expressing our disapproval of your hitting the child, or encouraging you to stop hitting the child. There is no truth to the matter of whether or not it is wrong for you to hit the child.\n\n\nAlthough this view of ethics has often been challenged, many of the objections have come from religious thinkers who appealed to God’s commands. Such arguments have limited appeal in the largely secular world of Western philosophy. Other defenses of objective truth in ethics made no appeal to religion, but could make little headway against the prevailing philosophical mood.\n\n\nLast month, however, saw a major philosophical event: the publication of Derek Parfit’s long-awaited book On What Matters. Until now, Parfit, who is Emeritus Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, had written only one book, Reasons and Persons, which appeared in 1984, to great acclaim. Parfit’s entirely secular arguments, and the comprehensive way in which he tackles alternative positions, have, for the first time in decades, put those who reject objectivism in ethics on the defensive.\n\n\nOn What Matters is a book of daunting length: two large volumes, totaling more than 1,400 pages, of densely argued text. But the core of the argument comes in the first 400 pages, which is not an insurmountable challenge for the intellectually curious – particularly given that Parfit, in the best tradition of English-language philosophy, always strives for lucidity, never using obscure words where simple ones will do. Each sentence is straightforward, the argument is clear, and Parfit often uses vivid examples to make his points. Thus, the book is an intellectual treat for anyone who wants to understand not so much “what matters” as whether anything really can matter, in an objective sense.\n\n\nMany people assume that rationality is always instrumental: reason can tell us only how to get what we want, but our basic wants and desires are beyond the scope of reasoning. Not so, Parfit argues. Just as we can grasp the truth that 1 + 1 = 2, so we can see that I have a reason to avoid suffering agony at some future time, regardless of whether I now care about, or have desires about, whether I will suffer agony at that time. We can also have reasons (though not always conclusive reasons) to prevent others from suffering agony. Such self-evident normative truths provide the basis for Parfit’s defense of objectivity in ethics.\n\n\nOne major argument against objectivism in ethics is that people disagree deeply about right and wrong, and this disagreement extends to philosophers who cannot be accused of being ignorant or confused. If great thinkers like Immanuel Kant and Jeremy Bentham disagree about what we ought to do, can there really be an objectively true answer to that question?\n\n\nParfit’s response to this line of argument leads him to make a claim that is perhaps even bolder than his defense of objectivism in ethics. He considers three leading theories about what we ought to do – one deriving from Kant, one from the social-contract tradition of Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, and the contemporary philosophers John Rawls and T.M. Scanlon, and one from Bentham’s utilitarianism – and argues that the Kantian and social-contract theories must be revised in order to be defensible.\n\n\nThen he argues that these revised theories coincide with a particular form of consequentialism, which is a theory in the same broad family as utilitarianism. If Parfit is right, there is much less disagreement between apparently conflicting moral theories than we all thought. The defenders of each of these theories are, in Parfit’s vivid phrase, “climbing the same mountain on different sides.”\n\n\nReaders who go to On What Matters seeking an answer to the question posed by its title might be disappointed. Parfit’s real interest is in combating subjectivism and nihilism. Unless he can show that objectivism is true, he believes, nothing matters.\n\n\nWhen Parfit does come to the question of “what matters,” his answer might seem surprisingly obvious.

The Daily Beast   Obama’s True Claim to Fame   Michael Tomasky       August 23, 2011 -- Barack Obama hasn’t been much of a domestic-policy president from nearly anyone’s point of view. And it’s a little hard to picture how he might ever be seen as such—that is to say, even if he’s reelected, he’ll probably have a Republican House or Senate (or both) that will thwart him at every turn, so the best he’ll be able to say is that he presided over a slow and very difficult economic recovery, which presumably will finally happen by January 2017. But foreign policy could be a completely different story. Here one can see how he might become not just a good but a great foreign-policy president. Yes, of course, let’s stipulate: the war isn’t actually, you know, over. And even after it is, Libya could descend into chaos or extremism or both (although it is heartening to read that the National Transitional Council, the recognized new governing body, apparently has detailed governance plans in place). So could Egypt, and Tunisia, and so on and so on. Lots of things could, can, and undoubtedly will go wrong. Let’s also stipulate that Obama did not drape himself only in glory on Libya. The administration’s statement in June that the conflict wasn’t under the purview of the War Powers Act because bombing didn’t constitute “hostilities” was ridiculous. And many critics reasonably felt back in March that Obama was a little slow to pull the trigger on the intervention (I didn’t share that view).   All that said, the administration has already handled a lot of these changes well (and in the face of absolutely constant know-it-all criticism). One of the best things an American administration can do when big changes are afoot somewhere in the world is stay out of the way and not act as if we can will an outcome just because we’re America. We have a group in this country that likes to will outcomes, and their track record demonstrates that that doesn’t work so well (unless you think, apropos Iraq, that eight years and more than 100,000 lives later defines “well”). Obama has been more in the mold of George H.W. Bush and his secretary of state, Jim Baker, when the Eastern bloc was throwing off Moscow’s shackles. Offer encouragement and stability, give a few speeches about freedom, but otherwise let them do their own work. Obama took a lot of stick for not being more forceful on Egypt in February, but he was right to be cautious—there were lots of stakeholders involved, and sorry, but the president of the United States just can’t say every sweet thing romantics would like him to say. He then, as noted, took heat for moving too slowly on Libya, but here again he was correct. The nature of the Libyan regime is not a direct national-security issue, so there absolutely had to be a specific trigger to justify acting. That trigger was Gaddafi’s threatened assault on Benghazi. That was completely the right thing to do. It was as textbook a fulfillment of “R2P,” or “responsibility to protect,” as one could imagine. The subsequent bombing campaign took longer than advertised, but it has apparently done the job, quickly and with far smaller loss of life (including zero U.S. deaths) than if we’d followed John McCain and Lindsey Graham’s advice and gone in with ground troops. One of the best things an American administration can do when big changes are afoot somewhere in the world is stay out of the way and not act as if we can will an outcome just because we’re America. Next comes Syria. Conservatives are pushing Obama to take stronger steps. Maybe he should. I argued back in the spring, before Obama imposed sanctions on Assad, that he needed to be more forceful. But now he has imposed those sanctions and said Assad should step down. Doing much more seems dubious. Bashar al-Assad will go. It’s a matter of when. Better to let it play out. If a true R2P situation arises, then Obama will have to make some decisions. But it’s far better to let the Syrians do this themselves, if they can. We cannot prevent every casualty.  That’s starting to sound like a doctrine to me. Call it the doctrine of no doctrine: using our power and influence but doing so prudently and multilaterally, with the crucial recognition that Egypt is different from Libya is different from Syria is different from someplace else. According to the foreign-policy establishment, if you want to have a self-respecting big-D doctrine, you’re not supposed to recognize differences. The doctrine must guide all cases. But that is exactly the kind of thinking that has led—always—to tragedy. The Truman Doctrine was never meant to be applied to Vietnam. The Bush Doctrine was applied to Iraq based on a series of lies told to the American people. And so on. If the Obama Doctrine is nothing like those, so much the better.   This does not yet greatness make. These dramatic changes have to work out for the better, and here the United States has a huge role to play. With respect to Libya, for example, we have control of about $37 billion in assets we can dole out to the transitional council. And yes, we probably are interested in its oil. But that doesn’t have to mean stealing it. All the Western countries that backed the rebels have to play a constructive and non- (forgive me for such a dated word) imperialist role in helping the country build its future.   So there’s work to be done. But it’s hardly impossible to envision an Obama administration in a few years’ time that has drawn down Afghanistan and Iraq, helped foster reforms and maybe even the growth of a couple of democracies around the Middle East, and restored the standing of a country that Bush had laid such staggering waste. And killed Osama bin Laden. If this is weak America-hating, count me in.

Stratfor   Israeli-Arab Crisis Approaching   George Friedman      August 22, 2011 -- In September, the U.N. General Assembly will vote on whether to recognize Palestine as an independent and sovereign state with full rights in the United Nations. In many ways, this would appear to be a reasonable and logical step. Whatever the Palestinians once were, they are clearly a nation in the simplest and most important sense - namely, they think of themselves as a nation. Nations are created by historical circumstances, and those circumstances have given rise to a Palestinian nation. Under the principle of the United Nations and the theory of the right to national self-determination, which is the moral foundation of the modern theory of nationalism, a nation has a right to a state, and that state has a place in the family of nations. In this sense, the U.N. vote will be unexceptional.   However, when the United Nations votes on Palestinian statehood, it will intersect with other realities and other historical processes. First, it is one thing to declare a Palestinian state; it is quite another thing to create one. The Palestinians are deeply divided between two views of what the Palestinian nation ought to be, a division not easily overcome. Second, this vote will come at a time when two of Israel's neighbors are coping with their own internal issues. Syria is in chaos, with an extended and significant resistance against the regime having emerged. Meanwhile, Egypt is struggling with internal tension over the fall of President Hosni Mubarak and the future of the military junta that replaced him. Add to this the U.S. withdrawal from Iraq and the potential rise of Iranian power, and the potential recognition of a Palestinian state - while perfectly logical in an abstract sense - becomes an event that can force a regional crisis in the midst of ongoing regional crises. It thus is a vote that could have significant consequences.   The Palestinian Divide   Let's begin with the issue not of the right of a nation to have a state but of the nature of a Palestinian state under current circumstances. The Palestinians are split into two major factions. The first, Fatah, dominates the West Bank. Fatah derives its ideology from the older, secular Pan-Arab movement. Historically, Fatah saw the Palestinians as a state within the Arab nation. The second, Hamas, dominates Gaza. Unlike Fatah, it sees the Palestinians as forming part of a broader Islamist uprising, one in which Hamas is the dominant Islamist force of the Palestinian people.   The Pan-Arab rising is moribund. Where it once threatened the existence of Muslim states, like the Arab monarchies, it is now itself threatened. Mubarak, Syrian President Bashar al Assad and Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi all represented the old Pan-Arab vision. A much better way to understand the \"Arab Spring\" is that it represented the decay of such regimes that were vibrant when they came to power in the late 1960s and early 1970s but have fallen into ideological meaninglessness. Fatah is part of this grouping, and while it still speaks for Palestinian nationalism as a secular movement, beyond that it is isolated from broader trends in the region. It is both at odds with rising religiosity and simultaneously mistrusted by the monarchies it tried to overthrow. Yet it controls the Palestinian proto-state, the Palestinian National Authority, and thus will be claiming a U.N. vote on Palestinian statehood. Hamas, on the other hand, is very much representative of current trends in the Islamic world and holds significant popular support, yet it is not clear that it holds a majority position in the Palestinian nation.   All nations have ideological divisions, but the Palestinians are divided over the fundamental question of the Palestinian nation's identity. Fatah sees itself as part of a secular Arab world that is on the defensive. Hamas envisions the Palestinian nation as an Islamic state forming in the context of a region-wide Islamist rising. Neither is in a position to speak authoritatively for the Palestinian people, and the things that divide them cut to the heart of the nation. As important, each has a different view of its future relations with Israel. Fatah has accepted, in practice, the idea of Israel's permanence as a state and the need of the Palestinians to accommodate themselves to the reality. Hamas has rejected it.   The U.N. decision raises the stakes in this debate within the Palestinian nation that could lead to intense conflict. As vicious as the battle between Hamas and Fatah has been, an uneasy truce has existed over recent years. Now, there could emerge an internationally legitimized state, and control of that state will matter more than ever before. Whoever controls the state defines what the Palestinians are, and it becomes increasingly difficult to suspend the argument for a temporary truce. Rather than settling anything, or putting Israel on the defensive, the vote will compel a Palestinian crisis.   Fatah has an advantage in any vote on Palestinian statehood: It enjoys far more international support than Hamas does. Europeans and Americans see it as friendly to their interests and less hostile to Israel. The Saudis and others may distrust Fatah from past conflicts, but in the end they fear radical Islamists and Iran and so require American support at a time when the Americans have tired of playing in what some Americans call the \"sandbox.\" However reluctantly, while aiding Hamas, the Saudis are more comfortable with Fatah. And of course, the embattled Arabist regimes, whatever tactical shifts there may have been, spring from the same soil as Fatah. While Fatah is the preferred Palestinian partner for many, Hamas can also use that reality to portray Fatah as colluding with Israel against the Palestinian people during a confrontation.   For its part, Hamas has the support of Islamists in the region, including Shiite Iranians, but that is an explosive mix to base a strategy on. Hamas must break its isolation if it is to counter the tired but real power of Fatah. Symbolic flotillas from Turkey are comforting, but Hamas needs an end to Egyptian hostility to Hamas more than anything.   Egypt's Role and Fatah on the Defensive   Egypt is the power that geographically isolates Hamas through its treaty with Israel and with its still-functional blockade on Gaza. More than anyone, Hamas needs genuine regime change in Egypt. The new regime it needs is not a liberal democracy but one in which Islamist forces supportive of Hamas, namely the Muslim Brotherhood, come to power.   At the moment, that is not likely. Egypt's military has retained a remarkable degree of control, its opposition groups are divided between secular and religious elements, and the religious elements are further divided among themselves - as well as penetrated by an Egyptian security apparatus that has made war on them for years. As it stands, Egypt is not likely to evolve in a direction favorable to Hamas. Therefore, Hamas needs to redefine the political situation in Egypt to convert a powerful enemy into a powerful friend.   Though it is not easy for a small movement to redefine a large nation, in this case, it could perhaps happen. There is a broad sense of unhappiness in Egypt over Egypt's treaty with Israel, an issue that comes to the fore when Israel and the Palestinians are fighting. As in other Arab countries, passions surge in Egypt when the Palestinians are fighting the Israelis.   Under Mubarak, these passions were readily contained in Egypt. Now the Egyptian regime unquestionably is vulnerable, and pro-Palestinian feelings cut across most, if not all, opposition groups. It is a singular, unifying force that might suffice to break the military's power, or at least to force the military to shift its Israeli policy.   Hamas in conflict with Israel as the United Nations votes for a Palestinian state also places Fatah on the political defensive among the Palestinians. Fatah cooperation with Israel while Gaza is at war would undermine Fatah, possibly pushing Fatah to align with Hamas. Having the U.N. vote take place while Gaza is at war, a vote possibly accompanied by General Assembly condemnation of Israel, could redefine the region.   Last week's attack on the Eilat road should be understood in this context. Some are hypothesizing that new Islamist groups forming in the Sinai or Palestinian groups in Gaza operating outside Hamas' control carried out the attack. But while such organizations might formally be separate from Hamas, I find it difficult to believe that Hamas, with an excellent intelligence service inside Gaza and among the Islamist groups in the Sinai, would not at least have known these groups' broad intentions and would not have been in a position to stop them. Just as Fatah created Black September in the 1970s, a group that appeared separate from Fatah but was in fact covertly part of it, the strategy of creating new organizations to take the blame for conflicts is an old tactic both for the Palestinians and throughout the world.   Hamas' ideal attack would offer it plausible deniability - allowing it to argue it did not even know an attack was imminent, much less carry it out - and trigger an Israeli attack on Gaza. Such a scenario casts Israel as the aggressor and Hamas as the victim, permitting Hamas to frame the war to maximum effect in Egypt and among the Palestinians, as well as in the wider Islamic world and in Europe.   Regional Implications and Israel's Dilemma   The matter goes beyond Hamas. The Syrian regime is currently fighting for its life against its majority Sunni population. It has survived thus far, but it needs to redefine the conflict. The Iranians and Hezbollah are among those most concerned with the fall of the Syrian regime. Syria has been Iran's one significant ally, one strategically positioned to enhance Iranian influence in the Levant. Its fall would be a strategic setback for Iran at a time when Tehran is looking to enhance its position with the U.S. withdrawal from Iraq. Iran, which sees the uprising as engineered by its enemies - the United States, Saudi Arabia and Turkey - understandably wants al Assad to survive.   Meanwhile, the fall of Syria would leave Hezbollah - which is highly dependent on the current Syrian regime and is in large part an extension of Syrian policy in Lebanon - wholly dependent on Iran. And Iran without its Syrian ally is very far away from Hezbollah. Like Tehran, Hezbollah thus also wants al Assad to survive. Hezbollah joining Hamas in a confrontation with Israel would take the focus off the al Assad regime and portray his opponents as undermining resistance to Israel. Joining a war with Israel also would make it easier for Hezbollah to weather the fall of al Assad should his opponents prevail. It would help Hezbollah create a moral foundation for itself independent of Syria. Hezbollah's ability to force a draw with Israel in 2006 constituted a victory for the radical Islamist group that increased its credibility dramatically.   The 2006 military confrontation was also a victory for Damascus, as it showed the Islamic world that Syria was the only nation-state supporting effective resistance to Israel. It also showed Israel and the United States that Syria alone could control Hezbollah and that forcing Syria out of Lebanon was a strategic error on the part of Israel and the United States.   Faced with this dynamic, it will be difficult for Fatah to maintain its relationship with Israel. Indeed, Fatah could be forced to initiate an intifada, something it would greatly prefer to avoid, as this would undermine what economic development the West Bank has experienced.   Israel therefore conceivably could face conflict in Gaza, a conflict along the Lebanese border and a rising in the West Bank, something it clearly knows. In a rare move, Israel announced plans to call up reserves in September. Though preannouncements of such things are not common, Israel wants to signal resolution.   Israel has two strategies in the face of the potential storm. One is a devastating attack on Gaza followed by rotating forces to the north to deal with Hezbollah and intense suppression of an intifada. Dealing with Gaza fast and hard is the key if the intention is to abort the evolution I laid out. But the problem here is that the three-front scenario I laid out is simply a possibility; there is no certainty here. If Israel initiates conflict in Gaza and fails, it risks making a possibility into a certainty - and Israel has not had many stunning victories for several decades. It could also create a crisis for Egypt's military rulers, not something the Israelis want.   Israel also simply could absorb the attacks from Hamas to make Israel appear the victim. But seeking sympathy is not likely to work given how Palestinians have managed to shape global opinion. Moreover, we would expect Hamas to repeat its attacks to the point that Israel no longer could decline combat.   War thus benefits Hamas (even if Hamas maintains plausible deniability by having others commit the attacks), a war Hezbollah has good reason to enter at such a stage and that Fatah does not want but could be forced into. Such a war could shift the Egyptian dynamic significantly to Hamas' advantage, while Iran would certainly want al-Assad to be able to say to Syrians that a war with Israel is no time for a civil war in Syria. Israel would thus find itself fighting three battles simultaneously. The only way to do that is to be intensely aggressive, making moderation strategically difficult.   Israel responded modestly compared to the past after the Eilat incident, mounting only limited attacks on Gaza against mostly members of the Palestinian Resistance Committees, an umbrella group known to have links with Hamas. Nevertheless, Hamas has made clear that its de facto truce with Israel was no longer assured. The issue now is what Hamas is prepared to do and whether Hamas supporters, Saudi Arabia in particular, can force them to control anti-Israeli activities in the region. The Saudis want al Assad to fall, and they do not want a radical regime in Egypt. Above all, they do not want Iran's hand strengthened. But it is never clear how much influence the Saudis or Egyptians have over Hamas. For Hamas, this is emerging as the perfect moment, and it is hard to believe that even the Saudis can restrain them. As for the Israelis, what will happen depends on what others decide - which is the fundamental strategic problem that Israel has.

The Financial Times    Why Assad need not fear Gaddafi’s fate   Ed Husain      August 23, 2011 -- The dramatic scenes in Tripoli are already being seized upon by those keen to depose other despotic regimes. Taken alongside the unstable situation in Syria, there is now a risk of a dangerous moment of western triumphalism. This must be resisted, especially given that the odds of overthrowing dictator Bashar al-Assad are so small.    After months of holding his nerve, US president Barack Obama last week succumbed to calls from commentators and Syrian opposition leaders, and demanded Mr Assads removal. The decision was a mistake. Earlier in the week, Hillary Clinton, secretary of state, noted that, “if the US called for Mr Assad’s head, then what?”. And, indeed, then what? I lived in Syria for two years and still visit regularly, so I know only too well that the US is viewed with deep animosity. Officials told me many times, and with straight faces, that America is at war with Arabs and Muslims – a view also ingrained among the wider population, particularly after the Iraq war.   Calls for regime change will thus help Syria, as Mr Assad defies the west with ease. As elsewhere in the Middle East, defying Washington is a cause of strength and popularity, as Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran show. Every passing day will now be seen as a humiliation for Mr Obama, while the fragmented and shambolic Syrian opposition will be more credibly dubbed “American stooges” or “Zionist agents”. For a population that is vehemently anti-American and anti-Israel, such labels are powerful and destructive.   The regime has been barbaric in responding to the brave people on the streets, but we must be careful about accepting the narrative that the whole of Syria is demanding change. The largest cities of Aleppo and Damascus remain relatively calm, while opinion in western capitals is led by reports generated via opposition movements, often using social media of questionable reliability. The army has committed many atrocities but hundreds of its members appear to have been killed, too. In the absence of international media, it is debatable whether the protesters are altogether peaceful.   Already, calls for military intervention are being made by Syrian opposition activists in meetings at the White House and US state department. Yet such movements have led us astray before, as when politicians such as Ahmed Chalabi misled the US about realities in Iraq. In truth, Mr Assad’s regime is much less likely to fall than that of Muammer Gaddafi: there have been no high-profile political or military defections, while Mr Assad remains relatively popular among senior military commanders, Syrian mosque clerics, the middle classes and business leaders.   This brings us back to the “then what” question. The numbers being killed now will wither in comparison with a possible future civil war, if an increasingly sectarian Syria splinters between the ruling Alawites, the elite and urban Christians, the majority Sunnis, the Kurds, Druze and others. There is no civil society to engineer a peaceful transition, while Syria could plausibly become another Lebanon, acting as a proxy battleground for regional powers.   This risk partly explains why Syrias ally Turkey has exerted such effort to rein in the slaughter, and why Saudi Arabia, Russia and China have not joined America’s lead. They all want to give Mr Assad more time – because they recognise the thin chance of getting rid of him, and because they fear the violence that would follow if he did fall.   Almost 90 per cent of Syrias crude oil exports go to European countries. Almost $3bn of its annual trade is conducted with Turkey. Saudi Arabia is a regional power with vested interests in the country, and Russia and Syria enjoy historical relations, as well as arms deals. It is these countries that now must be on the front lines of reform, with the US largely working behind the scenes.   For the west, the most powerful and poignant moment in recent months came when US ambassador Robert Ford travelled to Hama, scene of protests, to show solidarity and monitor the regime’s actions. His quiet move warmed usually hostile Sunni communities elsewhere in the Middle East to America, while putting fear into the heart of the tyrant himself. Such innovative, soft power strategies will do more to help Syrian democracy than loud statements from the White House.    The most powerful pressure on Mr Assad so far, however, has been from Al Jazeera’s Arabic coverage, which encouraged Syrians to take control of their own destiny. This is surely right, for any long-term change must come from within. Sadly, in the short term and in a highly volatile region, at present Mr Assad remains the least worst option.

The Christian Science Monitor    Libya endgame: Lessons for Syria's protesters   Bilal Y. Saab     August 23, 2011 -- As the Libyan opposition's fight appears to be nearing a triumphant close, with rebels having taken over Muammar Qaddafis compound in Tripoli, the showdown between largely peaceful protesters and regime forces in Syria rages on and shows no signs of abating. But Mr. Qaddafi’s ouster could help turn the tide for the Syrian opposition – especially if it takes the lessons from Libya to heart.   One would assume that the escalating pressure on Qaddafi’s regime would have been enough to shake Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and push him to stop the bloodbath against his own people. Forget about it. With his speech on Sunday (when all signs pointed to Qaddafis imminent downfall) in which he rebuffed Western calls to resign, Mr. Assad is now more defiant than ever. His message is unambiguous: Extensive international pressure notwithstanding, he is not going down without a fight.   RELATED: Spots to watch in the battle for Tripoli   The popular uprisings in Libya and Syria (and elsewhere in the Middle East) have similar root causes – decades-old authoritarian politics, harsh political repression, denial of freedoms, and bad economics – but they have taken different paths, which may lead them to very different ends.   Commentators and analysts have been quick to state that Assad’s days are numbered. That may be true. Facing international isolation of unprecedented scale and a growing protest movement at home that is determined to depose him, the ruler of Syria is in deep trouble. It may be only a matter of time before Assad falls, but we simply do not know how long it will take and how it will unfold.   External intervention and support for anti-government forces is undoubtedly the most important issue that separates the Libyan case from the Syrian one. Slaughtered by Qaddafi’s regime, Libyan protesters did not hesitate to ask for Western military intervention, which they ultimately got in the form of a NATO aerial campaign. Let’s be honest and clear, without NATO’s air strikes, the no-fly zone, and the sanctions against Qaddafi, the civil war in Libya would have dragged on even longer, and rebel victory would have been extremely difficult if not impossible to achieve.   The majority of the protesters in Syria do not want Western military intervention. Their position is both courageous and rational, but it is not without costs and risks. With external military assistance (if the West sends arms or launches another NATO aerial campaign), they would be in a better position operationally to overthrow Assad, but their ability to govern their country in the future autonomously would be more limited (surely nothing is for free in international relations).   Without external military assistance, they are extremely vulnerable and at the mercy of Assad’s tanks and security forces, but if they pull his overthrow off, they will own their country’s future and put themselves in a position to better ward off future foreign meddling and interference. It is not an easy choice, but so far, the Syrian protesters have decided to go it alone, and one must understand and respect their remarkable position.   While the balance of forces currently tilts heavily in Assad’s favor, Qaddafis downfall might just be the necessary factor that will embolden the protesters and offer them a sizeable advantage. This is not naïve or farfetched. After all, it was the plight of Tunisian vendor Mohamed Bouazizi and the symbolism of his fate that sparked all the revolutions across the Middle East.   The images of the rebels in Libya liberating their country (as it seems they are close to doing) and chanting songs of freedom, like their Egyptian and Tunisian counterparts before them, will no doubt be another powerful inspiration and morale booster for the Syrian people.   Qaddafi’s departure will also make it possible for the international community to devote more attention and energy to Syria and come up with more creative and coordinated policies to assist the Syrian people, short of bombing Damascus or sending arms. That all eyes are currently on Assad is certainly bad news for the dictator.   Yet whatever the international community devises, the Syrian protest movement must do a better job organizing and convincing the world that it is more or less ready to take over once Assad falls. For that, the protesters need to create a truly united and inclusive political front (the National Council which the Syrian opposition formed today in Istanbul is a good first step, but it remains leaderless and still needs to come up with a tangible platform that goes beyond the demands for freedom and regime change).   Interviews with Arab intellectuals and ordinary citizens broadcast on satellite TV channels across the Arab world tell us that many Arabs believe that the rebels in Libya have made a mistake in asking for Western (“colonial”) military intervention. But the rebels' salvation is that they quickly came together and formed a transitional council, gaining world recognition and persuading major powers that the alternative to Qaddafi is indeed viable.   Right now, the West, and especially Syria’s neighbors, are concerned that Assad’s departure will lead to chaos and perhaps even sectarian, civil war that could spill over to other parts of the region.   Nobody and no amount of external assistance can help the Syrian protesters overcome their differences (as a Lebanese citizen, trust me on this one). But the sooner they speak with one voice, organize their ranks from within, and show the world that they are a mature and capable group able to turn Syria into a responsible democracy, the closer they will be to fulfilling their dream of toppling the Assad regime.   Their unity and organization are indeed more powerful than NATO’s bombs and more effective than the West’s sanctions. The lessons of Libya, Egypt, and Tunisia are clear: With unity comes historic opportunity.      Bilal Y.

Foreign Policy   Assad's Chemical Romance   Leonard Spector      AUGUST 23, 2011 -- The continued unrest in Syria, coupled with President Barack Obama's call for President Bashar al-Assad to leave power, has thrown the future of the country into flux. Among the most troubling uncertainties is the fate of Syria's chemical weapons arsenal, which, if not protected properly, could fall into the wrong hands, with catastrophic results. Syria is one of a handful of states that the U.S. government believes possess large stocks of chemical agents in militarized form -- that is, ready for use in artillery shells and bombs. The arsenal is thought to be massive, involving thousands of munitions and many tons of chemical agent, which range, according to CIA annual reports to Congress, from the blister gases of World War I -- such as mustard gas -- to advanced nerve agents such as sarin and possibly persistent nerve agents, such as VX gas.    In the hands of Assad -- and his father Hafez before him -- these weapons have been an ace-in-the-hole deterrent against Israel's nuclear capability. The Assad regime, however, has never openly brandished this capability: It did not employ chemical weapons in the 1982 Lebanon War against Israel, even after Israeli warplanes decimated the Syrian Air Force. Nor have they been deployed, or their use threatened, in attempting to bring Assad's current domestic antagonists to heel. And although Syria is accused of providing powerful missiles to Hezbollah, including some of a type that carried chemical warfare agents in the Soviet arsenal, Assad has not reportedly transferred lethal chemical capabilities to the Lebanon-based Shiite organization.    So despite their many faults and deplorable record on human rights, the Assads have treated their chemical arsenal with considerable care. But as the country potentially descends into chaos, will that hold true?    Let's start with the possibility of civil war. According to researchers at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, open sources indicate that there are at least four, and potentially five, chemical weapons production facilities in Syria. One or two are located near Damascus, the other three situated in Hama, Latakia, and al-Safira village, near the city of Aleppo. Hama is one of the hotbeds of the Syrian revolt, which Assad's tanks attacked in early August and where, more recently, fighting has severely damaged the city's hospitals. Latakia is another center of unrest; it was shelled by the Syrian Navy in mid-August. Aleppo, Syria's second-largest city has also seen significant demonstrations.    If anti-Assad insurgents take up arms, the chemical sites, as symbols of regime's authority, could become strategic targets. And, if mass defections occur from the Syrian army, there may be no one left to defend the sites against seizure. This could lead to disastrous outcomes -- including confiscation of the chemical weapons by a radical new national government, or sale of the weapons as war booty to organized non-state actors or criminal groups.    In such chaos, no one can predict who might control the weapons or where they might be taken. With these chemical weapons in the hands of those engaged in a possible civil war, the risks that they would be used would increase substantially. The problem would be worsened further if some possessors were not fully aware of the extent of the weapons' deadly effects.    And let's imagine that Assad is eventually removed: What leaders would gain control of these weapons after he departed? Saudi-backed Sunni groups? Iran-backed Shia organizations? Whoever they might be, it is unclear that the newcomers would follow the Assads' cautious-use doctrine and refusal to share chemical weapons with non-state groups, or that the new leaders would be able to maintain strict security measures at the chemical sites.    Meanwhile, it's possible that an existential threat will cause the Assad regime to abandon its previous policy of restraint regarding chemical weapons. It is not a huge leap from attacking civilians with tank fire, machine guns, and naval artillery to deploying poison gas, and the shock effect and sense of dread engendered by even limited use could quash a city-wide uprising within an hour.    The options available to the United States to minimize these risks are limited at best. Washington has certainly warned Assad against using the weapons domestically. But with Assad already at risk of indictment for crimes against humanity, and given his likely belief that the United States will not intervene militarily due to its commitments elsewhere -- including its politically unpopular and still opaque involvement in Libya -- U.S. warnings may have little deterrent effect.    A preemptive Israeli military strike to destroy the weapons does not appear technically feasible: Even if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu were ready to change the status quo, Assad is believed to have stored bulk chemical agents and filled (or quickly filled) shells and bombs in underground bunkers at multiple sites throughout the country. Moreover, even if Israel used incendiary bombs in an attempt to incinerate the chemical agents, the risk of dispersing large quantities of poisonous liquids would remain, with the potential to cause large-scale casualties.    The Obama administration needs to start planning now to manage Assad's chemical weapons legacy. If a new government replaces Assad -- or even if different groups compete for international recognition -- a U.S.-led coalition, including Turkey and the leading Arab states, should demand as a condition of support that the weapons immediately be placed under control of international monitors from the Hague-based Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and plans developed for their destruction. Hopefully, Syria's new leaders will have genuine legitimacy and will not need to prop up their credibility at home by clinging to these barbaric weapons.

Washington Post   10 years after 9/11, al-Qaeda is down but not out   David Ignatius      August 24 -- Government officials refer to it blandly as the “SSE,” or Sensitive Site Exploitation. That’s their oblique term for the extraordinary cache of evidence that was carried away from Osama bin Laden’s compound the night the al-Qaeda leader was killed.   With the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks a few weeks away, it’s possible to use this evidence to sketch a vivid portrait of al-Qaeda, drawing on material contained in more than 100 computer storage devices, including thumb drives, DVDs and CDs, and more than a dozen computers or hard drives — all collected during the May 2 raid.   U.S. officials say three strong themes emerge from their reading of the files, most of which were communications between bin Laden and his top deputy Atiyah Abd al-Rahman. Indeed, because the Libyan-born Atiyah (who’s known to analysts by his first name) was the boss’s key link with the outside, officials see him as more important than bin Laden’s nominal successor, Ayman al-Zawahiri.   Here are the highlights:   ●Bin Laden retained until his death a passion to launch a significant attack against the United States, ideally linked to the 10th anniversary of 9/11. He and Atiyah communicated often about who might carry out such a strike, with Atiyah proposing names and bin Laden rejecting them. Bin Laden was still looking for a history-changing attack on big, economically important targets — one that would match, if not outdo, the impact of 9/11. Zawahiri, by contrast, favored an opportunistic strategy of smaller strikes.   ●Bin Laden was a hands-on chief executive, with a role in operations planning and personnel decisions, rather than the detached senior leader that U.S. analysts had hypothesized. Zawahiri, whom the analysts had imagined as the day-to-day leader, was actually quite isolated — and remains so, despite a dozen communications this year. Zawahiri suffers from mistrust between his Egyptian faction of al-Qaeda and other operatives, such as Atiyah.   ●Bin Laden was suffering badly from drone attacks on al-Qaeda’s base in the tribal areas of Pakistan. He called this the “intelligence war,” and said it was “the only weapon that’s hurting us.” His cadres complained that they couldn’t train in the tribal areas, couldn’t communicate, couldn’t travel easily and couldn’t draw new recruits to what amounted to a free-fire zone. Bin Laden discussed moving al-Qaeda’s base to another location, but he never took action.   Analysts did not find in the material any smoking gun to suggest Pakistani government complicity in bin Laden’s presence in Abbottabad. And it’s clear he was paranoid about being found and killed: He ordered his subordinates to restrict movements to help preserve what remained of al-Qaeda in Pakistan. Fear of being discovered was a subject of regular conversation between bin Laden, Atiyah, Zawahiri and others.   Bin Laden also worried that al- Qaeda’s status among Muslims was dwindling, and that the West had at least partially succeeded in distancing al-Qaeda’s message from core Islamic values. Concerned about this eroding base, bin Laden counseled affiliates in North Africa and Yemen to hold back on their efforts to develop a local Islamic extremist state in favor of attacking the United States and its interests.   This fear that al-Qaeda’s extreme tactics were burning too hot and alienating Muslims was also the theme of a remarkable message that Atiyah sent in 2005 to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the murderous chief of al-Qaeda in Iraq. In this document, made public five years ago by the United States, Atiyah warned that fomenting Sunni-Shiite violence (which was Zarqawi’s trademark) was potentially ruinous.   The al-Qaeda that emerges from these documents is a badly battered and disoriented group. The June 3 death of Ilyas Kashmiri in a drone attack illustrates the organization’s continuing vulnerability. Kashmiri was a ruthless operator who planned the 2008 Mumbai attacks that killed 166 people and was plotting deadly attacks on Europe last winter that were stopped only because of aggressive counterterrorism work. (Security services from Europe and Turkey arrested about 20 of Kashmiri’s operatives before they could carry out the attacks.)   When top U.S. officials summarize their view of al-Qaeda now, in the run-up to the 9/11 anniversary, they describe an organization that is down but certainly not out. They don’t know of any specific plots targeting the United States, 10 years on. But they’re looking, pulsing every channel they know. They recognize that it’s what we still don’t know about al-Qaeda that’s most dangerous.   The Washington Post       \fArticle 7.   Hurriyet   Why Golda Meir was right   Burak Bekdil       August 23, 2011 -- It has been more than two and a half years since Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan told to Israeli President Shimon Peres’s face, “You (Jews) know well how to kill.” Prime Minister Erdoğan has also declared more than a few times that the main obstacle to peace in this part of the world is Israel, once calling the Jewish state “a festering boil in the Middle East that spreads hate and enmity.” In this holy month of Ramadan full of blood on Muslim territories, let’s try to identify who are the ones who know well how to kill.  As the Syrian death count clicks every day to come close to 2,000, the Turkish-Kurdish death count does not stop, already over 40,000 since 1984, both adding to the big pool of blood called the Middle East. Only during this Ramadan, the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK’s, death toll has reached 50 in this Muslim Kurds vs. Muslim Turks war. This excludes the PKK casualties in Turkey and in northern Iraq due to Turkish military retaliation since they are seldom accurately reported.   Let’s speak of facts.   Sudan is not in the conventional Middle East, so let’s ignore the genocide there. Let’s ignore, also, the West Pakistani massacres in East Pakistan (Bangladesh) totaling 1.25 million in 1971. Or 200,000 deaths in Algeria in war between Islamists and the government in 1991-2006.  But a simple, strictly Middle East research will give you one million deaths in the all-Muslim Iran-Iraq war; 300,000 Muslim minorities killed by Saddam Hussein; 80,000 Iranians killed during the Islamic revolution; 25,000 deaths in 1970-71, the days of Black September, by the Jordanian government in its fight against the Palestinians; and 20,000 Islamists killed in 1982 by the elder al-Assad in Hama. The World Health Organization’s estimate of Osama bin Laden’s carnage in Iraq was already 150,000 a few years earlier.   In a 2007 research, Gunnar Heinsohn from the University of Bremen and Daniel Pipes, director of the Middle East Forum, found out that some 11 million Muslims have been violently killed since 1948, of which 35,000, (0.3 percent) died during the six years of Arab war against Israel, or one out of every 315 fatalities. In contrast, over 90 percent who perished were killed by fellow Muslims.  According to Mssrs. Heinsohn and Pipes, the grisly inventory finds the total number of deaths in conflicts all over the world since 1950 numbering around 85 million. Of that, the Muslim Arab deaths in the Arab-Israeli conflict were at 46,000 including 11,000 during Israel’s war of independence. That makes 0.05 percent of all deaths in all conflicts, or 0.4 percent of all Arab deaths in the Arab-Israeli conflict.   In another calculation ignoring “small” massacres like the one that goes on in Syria and other deaths during the Arab Spring, only Saddam’s Iraq, Jordan, the elder al-Assad’s Syria, Iran-Iraq war, the bin Laden campaign in Iraq, the Iranian Islamic revolution and the Turkish-Kurdish conflict caused 1.65 million Muslim deaths by Muslims compared to less than 50,000 deaths in the Arab-Israeli conflict since 1950, including fatalities during and after Operation Cast Lead which came after the Heinsohn-Pipes study. For those who don’t have a calculator ready at their desks, allow me to tell: 50,000 is three percent of 1.65 million.  Golda Meir, the fourth prime minister of Israel, or rather the “Mother of Israel,” had a perfectly realistic point when she said that peace in the Middle East would only be possible “when Arabs love their children more than they hate us.”       Burak Bekdil is an Ankara-based freelance journalist.                                       1                      \fdir   Project \\G{00020 0046}# 2.0#0#C: \\Windows \\system3 e2.tlb #OLE Aut omation Tem plate rs\\Avi\\D esktop\\1 6gust.do8tx DF8D04C- 5BFA-101@B-BDE5€†AjA€„4€ ram File s\\Common Microso ft Share d\\OFFICE 12\\MSO.D MSForms&gt; EE1-E08F 608C4D0B„B4™sFM20L'EB 9EE847B- AB10-4A0 9-8EF8-4 8FD1B71D Data\\Loc al\\ ¢\\Wor0d8.0ÀbB7.e&lt;xdÈcU&lt; ThisDoc umentG       \f__SRP_0   *\\CC:\\Users\\Avi\\Desktop\\1 August.dotxrU Project1 Project ThisDocument C:\\PROGRA~1\\COMMON~1\\MICROS~1\\VBA\\VBA6\\VBE6.DLL C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office\\Office12\\MSWORD.OLB C:\\Windows\\system32\\stdole2.tlb stdole Document   C:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\Microsoft Shared\\OFFICE12\\MSO.DLL Office   C:\\Windows\\system32\\FM20.DLL MSForms   C:\\Users\\Avi\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Word8.0\\MSForms.exd         \f__SRP_1         \f__SRP_2         \f__SRP_3         \fThisDocument   heVFZe :1TemplateProject.ThisDocument     \\Rffff*0L4ff307d6ǟ Attribut e VB_Nam e = \"Thi sDocumen 1Templa teProjec hGlobaBl Cre atabl Pr@edecla Tru  BEx0pose $Cust0omiz       \f_VBA_PROJECT   G{000204EF-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}#4.0#9#C:\\PROGRA~1\\COMMON~1\\MICROS~1\\VBA\\VBA6\\VBE6.DLL#Visual Basic For Applications G{00020905-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}#8.4#0#C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office\\Office12\\MSWORD.OLB#Microsoft Word 12.0 Object Library G{00020430-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}#2.0#0#C:\\Windows\\system32\\stdole2.tlb#OLE Automation CC:\\Users\\Avi\\Desktop\\1 August.dotx *\\C1 August.dotx G{2DF8D04C-5BFA-101B-BDE5-00AA0044DE52}#2.4#0#C:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\Microsoft Shared\\OFFICE12\\MSO.DLL#Microsoft Office 12.0 Object Library G{0D452EE1-E08F-101A-852E-02608C4D0BB4}#2.0#0#C:\\Windows\\system32\\FM20.DLL#Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library G{49EE847B-AB10-4A09-8EF8-48FD1B71D07C}#2.0#0#C:\\Users\\Avi\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Word8.0\\MSForms.exd#Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library ThisDocument 0L4ff307d6 ThisDocument WordS1 Project1   stdole Project- ThisDocument&lt; _Evaluate TemplateProject Eà Office MSFormsC DefaultOcxName9+¥à DefaultOcxName8*¥à DefaultOcxName7)¥à DefaultOcxName6(¥à DefaultOcxName5'¥à DefaultOcxName4&¥à DefaultOcxName3%¥à DefaultOcxName2$¥à DefaultOcxName1#¥à DefaultOcxName Documentj Macro1 Macro2 Macro3 Macro4       \fPROJECT   ID=\"{9DD4350E-FA24-4804-B3B6-DD8D612106B5}\"    Document=ThisDocument/&H00000000   Name=\"Project\"   HelpContextID=\"0\"   VersionCompatible32=\"393222000\"   CMG=\"D9DB0AAA0EAA0EAA0EAA0E\"   DPB=\"2321F0BE3BBF3BBF3B\"   GC=\"6D6FBE084253435343AC\"      [Host Extender Info]   &H00000001={3832D640-CF90-11CF-8E43-00A0C911005A};VBE;&H00000000   &H00000002={000209F2-0000-0000-C000-000000000046};Word8.0;&H00000000          \fPROJECTwm   ThisDocument ThisDocument   \n\n                    \n24 August, 2011\n\n\nArticle 1.

And it’s a little hard to picture how he might ever be seen as such—that is to say, even if he’s reelected, he’ll probably have a Republican House or Senate (or both) that will thwart him at every turn, so the best he’ll be able to say is that he presided over a slow and very difficult economic recovery, which presumably will finally happen by January 2017. But foreign policy could be a completely different story. Here one can see how he might become not just a good but a great foreign-policy president. Yes, of course, let’s stipulate: the war isn’t actually, you know, over. And even after it is, Libya could descend into chaos or extremism or both (although it is heartening to read that the National Transitional Council, the recognized new governing body, apparently has detailed governance plans in place). So could Egypt, and Tunisia, and so on and so on. Lots of things could, can, and undoubtedly will go wrong. Let’s also stipulate that Obama did not drape himself only in glory on Libya. The administration’s statement in June that the conflict wasn’t under the purview of the War Powers Act because bombing didn’t constitute “hostilities” was ridiculous. And many critics reasonably felt back in March that Obama was a little slow to pull the trigger on the intervention (I didn’t share that view).\n\n\nAll that said, the administration has already handled a lot of these changes well (and in the face of absolutely constant know-it-all criticism). One of the best things an American administration can do when big changes are afoot somewhere in the world is stay out of the way and not act as if we can will an outcome just because we’re America. We have a group in this country that likes to will outcomes, and their track record demonstrates that that doesn’t work so well (unless you think, apropos Iraq, that eight years and more than 100,000 lives later defines “well”). Obama has been more in the mold of George H.W. Bush and his secretary of state, Jim Baker, when the Eastern bloc was throwing off Moscow’s shackles. Offer encouragement and stability, give a few speeches about freedom, but otherwise let them do their own work. Obama took a lot of stick for not being more forceful on Egypt in February, but he was right to be cautious—there were lots of stakeholders involved, and sorry, but the president of the United States just can’t say every sweet thing romantics would like him to say. He then, as noted, took heat for moving too slowly on Libya, but here again he was correct. The nature of the Libyan regime is not a direct national-security issue, so there absolutely had to be a specific trigger to justify acting. That trigger was Gaddafi’s threatened assault on Benghazi. That was completely the right thing to do. It was as textbook a fulfillment of “R2P,” or “responsibility to protect,” as one could imagine. The subsequent bombing campaign took longer than advertised, but it has apparently done the job, quickly and with far smaller loss of life (including zero U.S. deaths) than if we’d followed John McCain and Lindsey Graham’s advice and gone in with ground troops. One of the best things an American administration can do when big changes are afoot somewhere in the world is stay out of the way and not act as if we can will an outcome just because we’re America. Next comes Syria. Conservatives are pushing Obama to take stronger steps. Maybe he should. I argued back in the spring, before Obama imposed sanctions on Assad, that he needed to be more forceful. But now he has imposed those sanctions and said Assad should step down. Doing much more seems dubious. Bashar al-Assad will go. It’s a matter of when. Better to let it play out. If a true R2P situation arises, then Obama will have to make some decisions. But it’s far better to let the Syrians do this themselves, if they can. We cannot prevent every casualty.  That’s starting to sound like a doctrine to me. Call it the doctrine of no doctrine: using our power and influence but doing so prudently and multilaterally, with the crucial recognition that Egypt is different from Libya is different from Syria is different from someplace else. According to the foreign-policy establishment, if you want to have a self-respecting big-D doctrine, you’re not supposed to recognize differences. The doctrine must guide all cases. But that is exactly the kind of thinking that has led—always—to tragedy. The Truman Doctrine was never meant to be applied to Vietnam. The Bush Doctrine was applied to Iraq based on a series of lies told to the American people. And so on. If the Obama Doctrine is nothing like those, so much the better.   This does not yet greatness make. These dramatic changes have to work out for the better, and here the United States has a huge role to play. With respect to Libya, for example, we have control of about $37 billion in assets we can dole out to the transitional council. And yes, we probably are interested in its oil. But that doesn’t have to mean stealing it. All the Western countries that backed the rebels have to play a constructive and non- (forgive me for such a dated word) imperialist role in helping the country build its future.   So there’s work to be done. But it’s hardly impossible to envision an Obama administration in a few years’ time that has drawn down Afghanistan and Iraq, helped foster reforms and maybe even the growth of a couple of democracies around the Middle East, and restored the standing of a country that Bush had laid such staggering waste. And killed Osama bin Laden. If this is weak America-hating, count me in.\n\n\n\n\n\nNewsweek/Daily Beast special correspondent Michael Tomasky is also editor of Democracy: A Journal of Ideas.\n\n\n\n\fArticle 2.\n\n\nStratfor\n\n\nIsraeli-Arab Crisis Approaching\n\n\nGeorge Friedman\n\n\n\n\n\nAugust 22, 2011 -- In September, the U.N. General Assembly will vote on whether to recognize Palestine as an independent and sovereign state with full rights in the United Nations. In many ways, this would appear to be a reasonable and logical step. Whatever the Palestinians once were, they are clearly a nation in the simplest and most important sense - namely, they think of themselves as a nation. Nations are created by historical circumstances, and those circumstances have given rise to a Palestinian nation. Under the principle of the United Nations and the theory of the right to national self-determination, which is the moral foundation of the modern theory of nationalism, a nation has a right to a state, and that state has a place in the family of nations. In this sense, the U.N. vote will be unexceptional.\n\n\nHowever, when the United Nations votes on Palestinian statehood, it will intersect with other realities and other historical processes. First, it is one thing to declare a Palestinian state; it is quite another thing to create one. The Palestinians are deeply divided between two views of what the Palestinian nation ought to be, a division not easily overcome. Second, this vote will come at a time when two of Israel's neighbors are coping with their own internal issues. Syria is in chaos, with an extended and significant resistance against the regime having emerged. Meanwhile, Egypt is struggling with internal tension over the fall of President Hosni Mubarak and the future of the military junta that replaced him. Add to this the U.S. withdrawal from Iraq and the potential rise of Iranian power, and the potential recognition of a Palestinian state - while perfectly logical in an abstract sense - becomes an event that can force a regional crisis in the midst of ongoing regional crises. It thus is a vote that could have significant consequences.\n\n\nThe Palestinian Divide\n\n\nLet's begin with the issue not of the right of a nation to have a state but of the nature of a Palestinian state under current circumstances. The Palestinians are split into two major factions. The first, Fatah, dominates the West Bank. Fatah derives its ideology from the older, secular Pan-Arab movement. Historically, Fatah saw the Palestinians as a state within the Arab nation. The second, Hamas, dominates Gaza. Unlike Fatah, it sees the Palestinians as forming part of a broader Islamist uprising, one in which Hamas is the dominant Islamist force of the Palestinian people.\n\n\nThe Pan-Arab rising is moribund. Where it once threatened the existence of Muslim states, like the Arab monarchies, it is now itself threatened. Mubarak, Syrian President Bashar al Assad and Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi all represented the old Pan-Arab vision. A much better way to understand the \"Arab Spring\" is that it represented the decay of such regimes that were vibrant when they came to power in the late 1960s and early 1970s but have fallen into ideological meaninglessness. Fatah is part of this grouping, and while it still speaks for Palestinian nationalism as a secular movement, beyond that it is isolated from broader trends in the region. It is both at odds with rising religiosity and simultaneously mistrusted by the monarchies it tried to overthrow. Yet it controls the Palestinian proto-state, the Palestinian National Authority, and thus will be claiming a U.N. vote on Palestinian statehood. Hamas, on the other hand, is very much representative of current trends in the Islamic world and holds significant popular support, yet it is not clear that it holds a majority position in the Palestinian nation.\n\n\nAll nations have ideological divisions, but the Palestinians are divided over the fundamental question of the Palestinian nation's identity. Fatah sees itself as part of a secular Arab world that is on the defensive. Hamas envisions the Palestinian nation as an Islamic state forming in the context of a region-wide Islamist rising. Neither is in a position to speak authoritatively for the Palestinian people, and the things that divide them cut to the heart of the nation. As important, each has a different view of its future relations with Israel. Fatah has accepted, in practice, the idea of Israel's permanence as a state and the need of the Palestinians to accommodate themselves to the reality. Hamas has rejected it.\n\n\nThe U.N. decision raises the stakes in this debate within the Palestinian nation that could lead to intense conflict. As vicious as the battle between Hamas and Fatah has been, an uneasy truce has existed over recent years. Now, there could emerge an internationally legitimized state, and control of that state will matter more than ever before. Whoever controls the state defines what the Palestinians are, and it becomes increasingly difficult to suspend the argument for a temporary truce. Rather than settling anything, or putting Israel on the defensive, the vote will compel a Palestinian crisis.\n\n\nFatah has an advantage in any vote on Palestinian statehood: It enjoys far more international support than Hamas does. Europeans and Americans see it as friendly to their interests and less hostile to Israel. The Saudis and others may distrust Fatah from past conflicts, but in the end they fear radical Islamists and Iran and so require American support at a time when the Americans have tired of playing in what some Americans call the \"sandbox.\" However reluctantly, while aiding Hamas, the Saudis are more comfortable with Fatah. And of course, the embattled Arabist regimes, whatever tactical shifts there may have been, spring from the same soil as Fatah. While Fatah is the preferred Palestinian partner for many, Hamas can also use that reality to portray Fatah as colluding with Israel against the Palestinian people during a confrontation.\n\n\nFor its part, Hamas has the support of Islamists in the region, including Shiite Iranians, but that is an explosive mix to base a strategy on. Hamas must break its isolation if it is to counter the tired but real power of Fatah. Symbolic flotillas from Turkey are comforting, but Hamas needs an end to Egyptian hostility to Hamas more than anything.\n\n\nEgypt's Role and Fatah on the Defensive\n\n\nEgypt is the power that geographically isolates Hamas through its treaty with Israel and with its still-functional blockade on Gaza. More than anyone, Hamas needs genuine regime change in Egypt. The new regime it needs is not a liberal democracy but one in which Islamist forces supportive of Hamas, namely the Muslim Brotherhood, come to power.\n\n\nAt the moment, that is not likely. Egypt's military has retained a remarkable degree of control, its opposition groups are divided between secular and religious elements, and the religious elements are further divided among themselves - as well as penetrated by an Egyptian security apparatus that has made war on them for years. As it stands, Egypt is not likely to evolve in a direction favorable to Hamas. Therefore, Hamas needs to redefine the political situation in Egypt to convert a powerful enemy into a powerful friend.\n\n\nThough it is not easy for a small movement to redefine a large nation, in this case, it could perhaps happen. There is a broad sense of unhappiness in Egypt over Egypt's treaty with Israel, an issue that comes to the fore when Israel and the Palestinians are fighting. As in other Arab countries, passions surge in Egypt when the Palestinians are fighting the Israelis.\n\n\nUnder Mubarak, these passions were readily contained in Egypt. Now the Egyptian regime unquestionably is vulnerable, and pro-Palestinian feelings cut across most, if not all, opposition groups. It is a singular, unifying force that might suffice to break the military's power, or at least to force the military to shift its Israeli policy.\n\n\nHamas in conflict with Israel as the United Nations votes for a Palestinian state also places Fatah on the political defensive among the Palestinians. Fatah cooperation with Israel while Gaza is at war would undermine Fatah, possibly pushing Fatah to align with Hamas. Having the U.N. vote take place while Gaza is at war, a vote possibly accompanied by General Assembly condemnation of Israel, could redefine the region.\n\n\nLast week's attack on the Eilat road should be understood in this context. Some are hypothesizing that new Islamist groups forming in the Sinai or Palestinian groups in Gaza operating outside Hamas' control carried out the attack. But while such organizations might formally be separate from Hamas, I find it difficult to believe that Hamas, with an excellent intelligence service inside Gaza and among the Islamist groups in the Sinai, would not at least have known these groups' broad intentions and would not have been in a position to stop them. Just as Fatah created Black September in the 1970s, a group that appeared separate from Fatah but was in fact covertly part of it, the strategy of creating new organizations to take the blame for conflicts is an old tactic both for the Palestinians and throughout the world.\n\n\nHamas' ideal attack would offer it plausible deniability - allowing it to argue it did not even know an attack was imminent, much less carry it out - and trigger an Israeli attack on Gaza. Such a scenario casts Israel as the aggressor and Hamas as the victim, permitting Hamas to frame the war to maximum effect in Egypt and among the Palestinians, as well as in the wider Islamic world and in Europe.\n\n\nRegional Implications and Israel's Dilemma\n\n\nThe matter goes beyond Hamas. The Syrian regime is currently fighting for its life against its majority Sunni population. It has survived thus far, but it needs to redefine the conflict. The Iranians and Hezbollah are among those most concerned with the fall of the Syrian regime. Syria has been Iran's one significant ally, one strategically positioned to enhance Iranian influence in the Levant. Its fall would be a strategic setback for Iran at a time when Tehran is looking to enhance its position with the U.S. withdrawal from Iraq. Iran, which sees the uprising as engineered by its enemies - the United States, Saudi Arabia and Turkey - understandably wants al Assad to survive.\n\n\nMeanwhile, the fall of Syria would leave Hezbollah - which is highly dependent on the current Syrian regime and is in large part an extension of Syrian policy in Lebanon - wholly dependent on Iran. And Iran without its Syrian ally is very far away from Hezbollah. Like Tehran, Hezbollah thus also wants al Assad to survive. Hezbollah joining Hamas in a confrontation with Israel would take the focus off the al Assad regime and portray his opponents as undermining resistance to Israel. Joining a war with Israel also would make it easier for Hezbollah to weather the fall of al Assad should his opponents prevail. It would help Hezbollah create a moral foundation for itself independent of Syria. Hezbollah's ability to force a draw with Israel in 2006 constituted a victory for the radical Islamist group that increased its credibility dramatically.\n\n\nThe 2006 military confrontation was also a victory for Damascus, as it showed the Islamic world that Syria was the only nation-state supporting effective resistance to Israel. It also showed Israel and the United States that Syria alone could control Hezbollah and that forcing Syria out of Lebanon was a strategic error on the part of Israel and the United States.\n\n\nFaced with this dynamic, it will be difficult for Fatah to maintain its relationship with Israel. Indeed, Fatah could be forced to initiate an intifada, something it would greatly prefer to avoid, as this would undermine what economic development the West Bank has experienced.\n\n\nIsrael therefore conceivably could face conflict in Gaza, a conflict along the Lebanese border and a rising in the West Bank, something it clearly knows. In a rare move, Israel announced plans to call up reserves in September. Though preannouncements of such things are not common, Israel wants to signal resolution.\n\n\nIsrael has two strategies in the face of the potential storm. One is a devastating attack on Gaza followed by rotating forces to the north to deal with Hezbollah and intense suppression of an intifada. Dealing with Gaza fast and hard is the key if the intention is to abort the evolution I laid out. But the problem here is that the three-front scenario I laid out is simply a possibility; there is no certainty here. If Israel initiates conflict in Gaza and fails, it risks making a possibility into a certainty - and Israel has not had many stunning victories for several decades. It could also create a crisis for Egypt's military rulers, not something the Israelis want.\n\n\nIsrael also simply could absorb the attacks from Hamas to make Israel appear the victim. But seeking sympathy is not likely to work given how Palestinians have managed to shape global opinion. Moreover, we would expect Hamas to repeat its attacks to the point that Israel no longer could decline combat.\n\n\nWar thus benefits Hamas (even if Hamas maintains plausible deniability by having others commit the attacks), a war Hezbollah has good reason to enter at such a stage and that Fatah does not want but could be forced into. Such a war could shift the Egyptian dynamic significantly to Hamas' advantage, while Iran would certainly want al-Assad to be able to say to Syrians that a war with Israel is no time for a civil war in Syria. Israel would thus find itself fighting three battles simultaneously. The only way to do that is to be intensely aggressive, making moderation strategically difficult.\n\n\nIsrael responded modestly compared to the past after the Eilat incident, mounting only limited attacks on Gaza against mostly members of the Palestinian Resistance Committees, an umbrella group known to have links with Hamas. Nevertheless, Hamas has made clear that its de facto truce with Israel was no longer assured. The issue now is what Hamas is prepared to do and whether Hamas supporters, Saudi Arabia in particular, can force them to control anti-Israeli activities in the region. The Saudis want al Assad to fall, and they do not want a radical regime in Egypt. Above all, they do not want Iran's hand strengthened. But it is never clear how much influence the Saudis or Egyptians have over Hamas. For Hamas, this is emerging as the perfect moment, and it is hard to believe that even the Saudis can restrain them. As for the Israelis, what will happen depends on what others decide - which is the fundamental strategic problem that Israel has.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Friedman is the Chief Executive Officer and founder of STRATFOR.

Taken alongside the unstable situation in Syria, there is now a risk of a dangerous moment of western triumphalism. This must be resisted, especially given that the odds of overthrowing dictator Bashar al-Assad are so small. \n\n\nAfter months of holding his nerve, US president Barack Obama last week succumbed to calls from commentators and Syrian opposition leaders, and demanded Mr Assads removal. The decision was a mistake. Earlier in the week, Hillary Clinton, secretary of state, noted that, “if the US called for Mr Assad’s head, then what?”. And, indeed, then what? I lived in Syria for two years and still visit regularly, so I know only too well that the US is viewed with deep animosity. Officials told me many times, and with straight faces, that America is at war with Arabs and Muslims – a view also ingrained among the wider population, particularly after the Iraq war.\n\n\nCalls for regime change will thus help Syria, as Mr Assad defies the west with ease. As elsewhere in the Middle East, defying Washington is a cause of strength and popularity, as Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran show. Every passing day will now be seen as a humiliation for Mr Obama, while the fragmented and shambolic Syrian opposition will be more credibly dubbed “American stooges” or “Zionist agents”. For a population that is vehemently anti-American and anti-Israel, such labels are powerful and destructive.\n\n\nThe regime has been barbaric in responding to the brave people on the streets, but we must be careful about accepting the narrative that the whole of Syria is demanding change. The largest cities of Aleppo and Damascus remain relatively calm, while opinion in western capitals is led by reports generated via opposition movements, often using social media of questionable reliability. The army has committed many atrocities but hundreds of its members appear to have been killed, too. In the absence of international media, it is debatable whether the protesters are altogether peaceful.\n\n\nAlready, calls for military intervention are being made by Syrian opposition activists in meetings at the White House and US state department. Yet such movements have led us astray before, as when politicians such as Ahmed Chalabi misled the US about realities in Iraq. In truth, Mr Assad’s regime is much less likely to fall than that of Muammer Gaddafi: there have been no high-profile political or military defections, while Mr Assad remains relatively popular among senior military commanders, Syrian mosque clerics, the middle classes and business leaders.\n\n\nThis brings us back to the “then what” question. The numbers being killed now will wither in comparison with a possible future civil war, if an increasingly sectarian Syria splinters between the ruling Alawites, the elite and urban Christians, the majority Sunnis, the Kurds, Druze and others. There is no civil society to engineer a peaceful transition, while Syria could plausibly become another Lebanon, acting as a proxy battleground for regional powers.\n\n\nThis risk partly explains why Syrias ally Turkey has exerted such effort to rein in the slaughter, and why Saudi Arabia, Russia and China have not joined America’s lead. They all want to give Mr Assad more time – because they recognise the thin chance of getting rid of him, and because they fear the violence that would follow if he did fall.\n\n\nAlmost 90 per cent of Syrias crude oil exports go to European countries. Almost $3bn of its annual trade is conducted with Turkey. Saudi Arabia is a regional power with vested interests in the country, and Russia and Syria enjoy historical relations, as well as arms deals. It is these countries that now must be on the front lines of reform, with the US largely working behind the scenes.\n\n\nFor the west, the most powerful and poignant moment in recent months came when US ambassador Robert Ford travelled to Hama, scene of protests, to show solidarity and monitor the regime’s actions. His quiet move warmed usually hostile Sunni communities elsewhere in the Middle East to America, while putting fear into the heart of the tyrant himself. Such innovative, soft power strategies will do more to help Syrian democracy than loud statements from the White House. \n\n\nThe most powerful pressure on Mr Assad so far, however, has been from Al Jazeera’s Arabic coverage, which encouraged Syrians to take control of their own destiny. This is surely right, for any long-term change must come from within. Sadly, in the short term and in a highly volatile region, at present Mr Assad remains the least worst option.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe writer is a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, and author of The Islamist \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\fArticle 4.\n\n\nThe Christian Science Monitor \n\n\nLibya endgame: Lessons for Syria's protesters\n\n\nBilal Y. Saab \n\n\n\nAugust 23, 2011 -- As the Libyan opposition's fight appears to be nearing a triumphant close, with rebels having taken over Muammar Qaddafis compound in Tripoli, the showdown between largely peaceful protesters and regime forces in Syria rages on and shows no signs of abating. But Mr. Qaddafi’s ouster could help turn the tide for the Syrian opposition – especially if it takes the lessons from Libya to heart.\n\n\nOne would assume that the escalating pressure on Qaddafi’s regime would have been enough to shake Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and push him to stop the bloodbath against his own people. Forget about it. With his speech on Sunday (when all signs pointed to Qaddafis imminent downfall) in which he rebuffed Western calls to resign, Mr. Assad is now more defiant than ever. His message is unambiguous: Extensive international pressure notwithstanding, he is not going down without a fight.\n\n\nRELATED: Spots to watch in the battle for Tripoli\n\n\nThe popular uprisings in Libya and Syria (and elsewhere in the Middle East) have similar root causes – decades-old authoritarian politics, harsh political repression, denial of freedoms, and bad economics – but they have taken different paths, which may lead them to very different ends.\n\n\nCommentators and analysts have been quick to state that Assad’s days are numbered. That may be true. Facing international isolation of unprecedented scale and a growing protest movement at home that is determined to depose him, the ruler of Syria is in deep trouble. It may be only a matter of time before Assad falls, but we simply do not know how long it will take and how it will unfold.\n\n\nExternal intervention and support for anti-government forces is undoubtedly the most important issue that separates the Libyan case from the Syrian one. Slaughtered by Qaddafi’s regime, Libyan protesters did not hesitate to ask for Western military intervention, which they ultimately got in the form of a NATO aerial campaign. Let’s be honest and clear, without NATO’s air strikes, the no-fly zone, and the sanctions against Qaddafi, the civil war in Libya would have dragged on even longer, and rebel victory would have been extremely difficult if not impossible to achieve.\n\n\nThe majority of the protesters in Syria do not want Western military intervention. Their position is both courageous and rational, but it is not without costs and risks. With external military assistance (if the West sends arms or launches another NATO aerial campaign), they would be in a better position operationally to overthrow Assad, but their ability to govern their country in the future autonomously would be more limited (surely nothing is for free in international relations).\n\n\nWithout external military assistance, they are extremely vulnerable and at the mercy of Assad’s tanks and security forces, but if they pull his overthrow off, they will own their country’s future and put themselves in a position to better ward off future foreign meddling and interference. It is not an easy choice, but so far, the Syrian protesters have decided to go it alone, and one must understand and respect their remarkable position.\n\n\nWhile the balance of forces currently tilts heavily in Assad’s favor, Qaddafis downfall might just be the necessary factor that will embolden the protesters and offer them a sizeable advantage. This is not naïve or farfetched. After all, it was the plight of Tunisian vendor Mohamed Bouazizi and the symbolism of his fate that sparked all the revolutions across the Middle East.\n\n\nThe images of the rebels in Libya liberating their country (as it seems they are close to doing) and chanting songs of freedom, like their Egyptian and Tunisian counterparts before them, will no doubt be another powerful inspiration and morale booster for the Syrian people.\n\n\nQaddafi’s departure will also make it possible for the international community to devote more attention and energy to Syria and come up with more creative and coordinated policies to assist the Syrian people, short of bombing Damascus or sending arms. That all eyes are currently on Assad is certainly bad news for the dictator.\n\n\nYet whatever the international community devises, the Syrian protest movement must do a better job organizing and convincing the world that it is more or less ready to take over once Assad falls. For that, the protesters need to create a truly united and inclusive political front (the National Council which the Syrian opposition formed today in Istanbul is a good first step, but it remains leaderless and still needs to come up with a tangible platform that goes beyond the demands for freedom and regime change).\n\n\nInterviews with Arab intellectuals and ordinary citizens broadcast on satellite TV channels across the Arab world tell us that many Arabs believe that the rebels in Libya have made a mistake in asking for Western (“colonial”) military intervention. But the rebels' salvation is that they quickly came together and formed a transitional council, gaining world recognition and persuading major powers that the alternative to Qaddafi is indeed viable.\n\n\nRight now, the West, and especially Syria’s neighbors, are concerned that Assad’s departure will lead to chaos and perhaps even sectarian, civil war that could spill over to other parts of the region.\n\n\nNobody and no amount of external assistance can help the Syrian protesters overcome their differences (as a Lebanese citizen, trust me on this one). But the sooner they speak with one voice, organize their ranks from within, and show the world that they are a mature and capable group able to turn Syria into a responsible democracy, the closer they will be to fulfilling their dream of toppling the Assad regime.\n\n\nTheir unity and organization are indeed more powerful than NATO’s bombs and more effective than the West’s sanctions. The lessons of Libya, Egypt, and Tunisia are clear: With unity comes historic opportunity.\n\n\n\n\n\nBilal Y.

Among the most troubling uncertainties is the fate of Syria's chemical weapons arsenal, which, if not protected properly, could fall into the wrong hands, with catastrophic results. Syria is one of a handful of states that the U.S. government believes possess large stocks of chemical agents in militarized form -- that is, ready for use in artillery shells and bombs. The arsenal is thought to be massive, involving thousands of munitions and many tons of chemical agent, which range, according to CIA annual reports to Congress, from the blister gases of World War I -- such as mustard gas -- to advanced nerve agents such as sarin and possibly persistent nerve agents, such as VX gas. \n\n\nIn the hands of Assad -- and his father Hafez before him -- these weapons have been an ace-in-the-hole deterrent against Israel's nuclear capability. The Assad regime, however, has never openly brandished this capability: It did not employ chemical weapons in the 1982 Lebanon War against Israel, even after Israeli warplanes decimated the Syrian Air Force. Nor have they been deployed, or their use threatened, in attempting to bring Assad's current domestic antagonists to heel. And although Syria is accused of providing powerful missiles to Hezbollah, including some of a type that carried chemical warfare agents in the Soviet arsenal, Assad has not reportedly transferred lethal chemical capabilities to the Lebanon-based Shiite organization. \n\n\nSo despite their many faults and deplorable record on human rights, the Assads have treated their chemical arsenal with considerable care. But as the country potentially descends into chaos, will that hold true? \n\n\nLet's start with the possibility of civil war. According to researchers at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, open sources indicate that there are at least four, and potentially five, chemical weapons production facilities in Syria. One or two are located near Damascus, the other three situated in Hama, Latakia, and al-Safira village, near the city of Aleppo. Hama is one of the hotbeds of the Syrian revolt, which Assad's tanks attacked in early August and where, more recently, fighting has severely damaged the city's hospitals. Latakia is another center of unrest; it was shelled by the Syrian Navy in mid-August. Aleppo, Syria's second-largest city has also seen significant demonstrations. \n\n\nIf anti-Assad insurgents take up arms, the chemical sites, as symbols of regime's authority, could become strategic targets. And, if mass defections occur from the Syrian army, there may be no one left to defend the sites against seizure. This could lead to disastrous outcomes -- including confiscation of the chemical weapons by a radical new national government, or sale of the weapons as war booty to organized non-state actors or criminal groups. \n\n\nIn such chaos, no one can predict who might control the weapons or where they might be taken. With these chemical weapons in the hands of those engaged in a possible civil war, the risks that they would be used would increase substantially. The problem would be worsened further if some possessors were not fully aware of the extent of the weapons' deadly effects. \n\n\nAnd let's imagine that Assad is eventually removed: What leaders would gain control of these weapons after he departed? Saudi-backed Sunni groups? Iran-backed Shia organizations? Whoever they might be, it is unclear that the newcomers would follow the Assads' cautious-use doctrine and refusal to share chemical weapons with non-state groups, or that the new leaders would be able to maintain strict security measures at the chemical sites. \n\n\nMeanwhile, it's possible that an existential threat will cause the Assad regime to abandon its previous policy of restraint regarding chemical weapons. It is not a huge leap from attacking civilians with tank fire, machine guns, and naval artillery to deploying poison gas, and the shock effect and sense of dread engendered by even limited use could quash a city-wide uprising within an hour. \n\n\nThe options available to the United States to minimize these risks are limited at best. Washington has certainly warned Assad against using the weapons domestically. But with Assad already at risk of indictment for crimes against humanity, and given his likely belief that the United States will not intervene militarily due to its commitments elsewhere -- including its politically unpopular and still opaque involvement in Libya -- U.S. warnings may have little deterrent effect. \n\n\nA preemptive Israeli military strike to destroy the weapons does not appear technically feasible: Even if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu were ready to change the status quo, Assad is believed to have stored bulk chemical agents and filled (or quickly filled) shells and bombs in underground bunkers at multiple sites throughout the country. Moreover, even if Israel used incendiary bombs in an attempt to incinerate the chemical agents, the risk of dispersing large quantities of poisonous liquids would remain, with the potential to cause large-scale casualties. \n\n\nThe Obama administration needs to start planning now to manage Assad's chemical weapons legacy. If a new government replaces Assad -- or even if different groups compete for international recognition -- a U.S.-led coalition, including Turkey and the leading Arab states, should demand as a condition of support that the weapons immediately be placed under control of international monitors from the Hague-based Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and plans developed for their destruction. Hopefully, Syria's new leaders will have genuine legitimacy and will not need to prop up their credibility at home by clinging to these barbaric weapons. \n\n\n\n\n\nLeonard Spector is executive director of the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies Washington, DC, office and formerly served as assistant deputy administrator for arms control and nonproliferation at the National Nuclear Security Administration. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\fArticle 6.\n\n\nWashington Post\n\n\n10 years after 9/11, al-Qaeda is down but not out\n\n\nDavid Ignatius\n\n\n\n\n\nAugust 24 -- Government officials refer to it blandly as the “SSE,” or Sensitive Site Exploitation. That’s their oblique term for the extraordinary cache of evidence that was carried away from Osama bin Laden’s compound the night the al-Qaeda leader was killed.\n\n\nWith the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks a few weeks away, it’s possible to use this evidence to sketch a vivid portrait of al-Qaeda, drawing on material contained in more than 100 computer storage devices, including thumb drives, DVDs and CDs, and more than a dozen computers or hard drives — all collected during the May 2 raid.\n\n\nU.S. officials say three strong themes emerge from their reading of the files, most of which were communications between bin Laden and his top deputy Atiyah Abd al-Rahman. Indeed, because the Libyan-born Atiyah (who’s known to analysts by his first name) was the boss’s key link with the outside, officials see him as more important than bin Laden’s nominal successor, Ayman al-Zawahiri.\n\n\nHere are the highlights:\n\n\n●Bin Laden retained until his death a passion to launch a significant attack against the United States, ideally linked to the 10th anniversary of 9/11. He and Atiyah communicated often about who might carry out such a strike, with Atiyah proposing names and bin Laden rejecting them. Bin Laden was still looking for a history-changing attack on big, economically important targets — one that would match, if not outdo, the impact of 9/11. Zawahiri, by contrast, favored an opportunistic strategy of smaller strikes.\n\n\n●Bin Laden was a hands-on chief executive, with a role in operations planning and personnel decisions, rather than the detached senior leader that U.S. analysts had hypothesized. Zawahiri, whom the analysts had imagined as the day-to-day leader, was actually quite isolated — and remains so, despite a dozen communications this year. Zawahiri suffers from mistrust between his Egyptian faction of al-Qaeda and other operatives, such as Atiyah.\n\n\n●Bin Laden was suffering badly from drone attacks on al-Qaeda’s base in the tribal areas of Pakistan. He called this the “intelligence war,” and said it was “the only weapon that’s hurting us.” His cadres complained that they couldn’t train in the tribal areas, couldn’t communicate, couldn’t travel easily and couldn’t draw new recruits to what amounted to a free-fire zone. Bin Laden discussed moving al-Qaeda’s base to another location, but he never took action.\n\n\nAnalysts did not find in the material any smoking gun to suggest Pakistani government complicity in bin Laden’s presence in Abbottabad. And it’s clear he was paranoid about being found and killed: He ordered his subordinates to restrict movements to help preserve what remained of al-Qaeda in Pakistan. Fear of being discovered was a subject of regular conversation between bin Laden, Atiyah, Zawahiri and others.\n\n\nBin Laden also worried that al-\nQaeda’s status among Muslims was dwindling, and that the West had at least partially succeeded in distancing al-Qaeda’s message from core Islamic values. Concerned about this eroding base, bin Laden counseled affiliates in North Africa and Yemen to hold back on their efforts to develop a local Islamic extremist state in favor of attacking the United States and its interests.\n\n\nThis fear that al-Qaeda’s extreme tactics were burning too hot and alienating Muslims was also the theme of a remarkable message that Atiyah sent in 2005 to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the murderous chief of al-Qaeda in Iraq. In this document, made public five years ago by the United States, Atiyah warned that fomenting Sunni-Shiite violence (which was Zarqawi’s trademark) was potentially ruinous.\n\n\nThe al-Qaeda that emerges from these documents is a badly battered and disoriented group. The June 3 death of Ilyas Kashmiri in a drone attack illustrates the organization’s continuing vulnerability. Kashmiri was a ruthless operator who planned the 2008 Mumbai attacks that killed 166 people and was plotting deadly attacks on Europe last winter that were stopped only because of aggressive counterterrorism work. (Security services from Europe and Turkey arrested about 20 of Kashmiri’s operatives before they could carry out the attacks.)\n\n\nWhen top U.S. officials summarize their view of al-Qaeda now, in the run-up to the 9/11 anniversary, they describe an organization that is down but certainly not out. They don’t know of any specific plots targeting the United States, 10 years on. But they’re looking, pulsing every channel they know. They recognize that it’s what we still don’t know about al-Qaeda that’s most dangerous.\n\n\nThe Washington Post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\fArticle 7.\n\n\nHurriyet\n\n\nWhy Golda Meir was right\n\n\nBurak Bekdil \n\n\n\n\n\nAugust 23, 2011 -- It has been more than two and a half years since Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan told to Israeli President Shimon Peres’s face, “You (Jews) know well how to kill.” Prime Minister Erdoğan has also declared more than a few times that the main obstacle to peace in this part of the world is Israel, once calling the Jewish state “a festering boil in the Middle East that spreads hate and enmity.” In this holy month of Ramadan full of blood on Muslim territories, let’s try to identify who are the ones who know well how to kill.  As the Syrian death count clicks every day to come close to 2,000, the Turkish-Kurdish death count does not stop, already over 40,000 since 1984, both adding to the big pool of blood called the Middle East. Only during this Ramadan, the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK’s, death toll has reached 50 in this Muslim Kurds vs. Muslim Turks war. This excludes the PKK casualties in Turkey and in northern Iraq due to Turkish military retaliation since they are seldom accurately reported.\n\n\nLet’s speak of facts.\n\n\nSudan is not in the conventional Middle East, so let’s ignore the genocide there. Let’s ignore, also, the West Pakistani massacres in East Pakistan (Bangladesh) totaling 1.25 million in 1971. Or 200,000 deaths in Algeria in war between Islamists and the government in 1991-2006.  But a simple, strictly Middle East research will give you one million deaths in the all-Muslim Iran-Iraq war; 300,000 Muslim minorities killed by Saddam Hussein; 80,000 Iranians killed during the Islamic revolution; 25,000 deaths in 1970-71, the days of Black September, by the Jordanian government in its fight against the Palestinians; and 20,000 Islamists killed in 1982 by the elder al-Assad in Hama. The World Health Organization’s estimate of Osama bin Laden’s carnage in Iraq was already 150,000 a few years earlier.\n\n\nIn a 2007 research, Gunnar Heinsohn from the University of Bremen and Daniel Pipes, director of the Middle East Forum, found out that some 11 million Muslims have been violently killed since 1948, of which 35,000, (0.3 percent) died during the six years of Arab war against Israel, or one out of every 315 fatalities. In contrast, over 90 percent who perished were killed by fellow Muslims.  According to Mssrs. Heinsohn and Pipes, the grisly inventory finds the total number of deaths in conflicts all over the world since 1950 numbering around 85 million. Of that, the Muslim Arab deaths in the Arab-Israeli conflict were at 46,000 including 11,000 during Israel’s war of independence. That makes 0.05 percent of all deaths in all conflicts, or 0.4 percent of all Arab deaths in the Arab-Israeli conflict.\n\n\nIn another calculation ignoring “small” massacres like the one that goes on in Syria and other deaths during the Arab Spring, only Saddam’s Iraq, Jordan, the elder al-Assad’s Syria, Iran-Iraq war, the bin Laden campaign in Iraq, the Iranian Islamic revolution and the Turkish-Kurdish conflict caused 1.65 million Muslim deaths by Muslims compared to less than 50,000 deaths in the Arab-Israeli conflict since 1950, including fatalities during and after Operation Cast Lead which came after the Heinsohn-Pipes study. For those who don’t have a calculator ready at their desks, allow me to tell: 50,000 is three percent of 1.65 million.  Golda Meir, the fourth prime minister of Israel, or rather the “Mother of Israel,” had a perfectly realistic point when she said that peace in the Middle East would only be possible “when Arabs love their children more than they hate us.” \n\n\n\n\n\nBurak Bekdil is an Ankara-based freelance journalist. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\fdir\n\n\nProject\n\\G{00020\n0046}#\n2.0#0#C:\n\\Windows\n\\system3\ne2.tlb\n#OLE Aut\nomation\nTem plate\nrs\\Avi\\D\nesktop\\1\n6gust.do8tx\nDF8D04C-\n5BFA-101@B-BDE5€†AjA€„4€\nram File\ns\\Common\nMicroso\nft Share\nd\\OFFICE\n12\\MSO.D\nMSForms&gt;\nEE1-E08F\n608C4D0B„B4™sFM20L'EB\n9EE847B-\nAB10-4A0\n9-8EF8-4\n8FD1B71D\nData\\Loc\nal\\ ¢\\Wor0d8.0ÀbB7.e&lt;xdÈcU&lt;\nThisDoc\numentG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\f__SRP_0\n\n\n*\\CC:\\Users\\Avi\\Desktop\\1 August.dotxrU\nProject1\nProject\nThisDocument\nC:\\PROGRA~1\\COMMON~1\\MICROS~1\\VBA\\VBA6\\VBE6.DLL\nC:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office\\Office12\\MSWORD.OLB\nC:\\Windows\\system32\\stdole2.tlb\nstdole\nDocument \n\nC:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\Microsoft Shared\\OFFICE12\\MSO.DLL\nOffice \n\nC:\\Windows\\system32\\FM20.DLL\nMSForms \n\nC:\\Users\\Avi\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Word8.0\\MSForms.exd \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\f__SRP_1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\f__SRP_2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\f__SRP_3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\fThisDocument\n\n\nheVFZe\n:1TemplateProject.ThisDocument  \n\\Rffff*0L4ff307d6ǟ\nAttribut\ne VB_Nam\ne = \"Thi\nsDocumen\n1Templa\nteProjec\nhGlobaBl\nCre atabl\nPr@edecla\nTru \nBEx0pose\n$Cust0omiz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\f_VBA_PROJECT\n\n\nG{000204EF-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}#4.0#9#C:\\PROGRA~1\\COMMON~1\\MICROS~1\\VBA\\VBA6\\VBE6.DLL#Visual Basic For Applications\nG{00020905-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}#8.4#0#C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office\\Office12\\MSWORD.OLB#Microsoft Word 12.0 Object Library\nG{00020430-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}#2.0#0#C:\\Windows\\system32\\stdole2.tlb#OLE Automation\nCC:\\Users\\Avi\\Desktop\\1 August.dotx *\\C1 August.dotx\nG{2DF8D04C-5BFA-101B-BDE5-00AA0044DE52}#2.4#0#C:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\Microsoft Shared\\OFFICE12\\MSO.DLL#Microsoft Office 12.0 Object Library\nG{0D452EE1-E08F-101A-852E-02608C4D0BB4}#2.0#0#C:\\Windows\\system32\\FM20.DLL#Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library\nG{49EE847B-AB10-4A09-8EF8-48FD1B71D07C}#2.0#0#C:\\Users\\Avi\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Word8.0\\MSForms.exd#Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library\nThisDocument\n0L4ff307d6\nThisDocument\nWordS1\nProject1 \n\nstdole\nProject-\nThisDocument&lt;\n_Evaluate\nTemplateProject Eà\nOffice\nMSFormsC\nDefaultOcxName9+¥à\nDefaultOcxName8*¥à\nDefaultOcxName7)¥à\nDefaultOcxName6(¥à\nDefaultOcxName5'¥à\nDefaultOcxName4&¥à\nDefaultOcxName3%¥à\nDefaultOcxName2$¥à\nDefaultOcxName1#¥à\nDefaultOcxName\nDocumentj\nMacro1\nMacro2\nMacro3\nMacro4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\fPROJECT\n\n\nID=\"{9DD4350E-FA24-4804-B3B6-DD8D612106B5}\" \n \nDocument=ThisDocument/&H00000000  \nName=\"Project\"  \nHelpContextID=\"0\"  \nVersionCompatible32=\"393222000\"  \nCMG=\"D9DB0AAA0EAA0EAA0EAA0E\"  \nDPB=\"2321F0BE3BBF3BBF3B\"  \nGC=\"6D6FBE084253435343AC\"  \n  \n[Host Extender Info]  \n&H00000001={3832D640-CF90-11CF-8E43-00A0C911005A};VBE;&H00000000  \n&H00000002={000209F2-0000-0000-C000-000000000046};Word8.0;&H00000000  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\fPROJECTwm\n\n\nThisDocument\nThisDocument\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNA\n\nFrom: NA\n\nTo: NA\n\nCC: NA\n\nSubject: NA\n\n                     17 November, 2011   Article 1.

NYT   U.S. Hones Warnings to Egypt as Military Stalls Transition   David D. Kirkpatrick and Steven Lee Myers      November 16, 2011 -- CAIRO — Brazen attempts by Egypt’s interim military rulers to hold on to power long after elections have elicited a sharp reaction domestically and for the first time have prompted Washington to warn about the potential for new unrest.    After months of mixing gentle pressure with broad support for the ruling military council, the Obama administration has sharpened its tone, senior administration officials say, expressing concern that the failure to move to civilian control could undermine the defining revolt of the Arab Spring.    The shift in tone is part of a difficult balancing act for Washington, which is keen to preserve its ties to the military and its interests in the region, chiefly Egypt’s role in maintaining peace with Israel. But Washington also hopes to win favor with Egypt’s newly empowered political opposition while avoiding the appearance of endorsing the militarys stalled transition to democracy. All things considered, some here have suggested, the change in tone may be intended to placate Egyptian public opinion rather than actually press the military to give up power.    “I think they are working for their own interests, particularly regarding the slow transition of power,” said Shady el-Ghazaly Harb, a prominent liberal activist who was among the leaders of the Egyptian revolution. “The U.S. wants to guarantee that the coming government will be on good terms — I won’t say loyal, but friendly — and the support for SCAF is related to that.” SCAF is the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, Egypt’s ruling military council.    Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton underscored the shift in a speech last week that her aides later said was a deliberate warning to the military council, which assumed power after President Hosni Mubarak’s ouster. The military had initially pledged to hand over control to civilians by September, but it now says that a presidential election will not occur before 2013. And last week it laid out a blueprint for the next constitution, giving the military special political powers and protection from civilian oversight into perpetuity.    “If, over time, the most powerful political force in Egypt remains a roomful of unelected officials, they will have planted the seeds for future unrest, and Egyptians will have missed a historic opportunity,” Mrs. Clinton warned.    “When unelected authorities say they want to be out of the business of governing,” the United States expects them “to lay out a clear road map” and “abide by it,” she added.    Given Washington’s long support for Mr. Mubarak, and Mrs. Clinton’s comment last month approving of the military’s extended timetable for electing a civilian president, there was suspicion over Washington’s intentions. The shift occurred at the same time as a broader effort by the Obama administration to counter anti-American sentiment and reach out to opposition leaders across the political spectrum.    The United States “wants to have the cake and eat it, too,” said Nabil Fahmy, a former Egyptian ambassador to Washington, arguing that the United States wants to promote democracy without dealing with the pressure it would put on American interests in the region.    The military’s attempts to protect its power and privileges indefinitely have created an awkward situation for Washington. The United States, through the Pentagon in particular, has long nurtured close ties with the Egyptian military, which still receives $1.3 billion in American aid each year. American officials hope that whatever government emerges will continue to support American policy, including maintaining ties with Israel and distance from Iran.    At the same time, the United States’ standing in public opinion in Egypt and around the region continues to suffer because of decades of support for undemocratic governments like the military-backed system that controlled Egypt under Mr. Mubarak. Remaining aloof from the debate over the military’s future role here risks reinforcing those criticisms at a time when democratic changes are giving public opinion new weight.    As part of its broader outreach, the Obama administration has also met with the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist group whose political party is poised to win a major role in the country’s new Parliament and remains the biggest political counterweight to the military council.    Jacob Walles, a deputy assistant secretary of state, met for the first time this week with the leaders of the Brotherhood’s newly formed Freedom and Justice Party at its new headquarters in Cairo. While American diplomats have had intermittent contacts for years with Brotherhood lawmakers in the Egyptian Parliament, officials here said Mr. Walles’s meeting appeared to underscore Mrs. Clinton’s pledges to cooperate with Islamist parties that respect democracy.    Others said it might instead have been a sign that Washington simply realized that the Brotherhood was certain to play a crucial role in Egypt’s future and was likely to win a large bloc of seats in the parliamentary elections that begin this month.    “They confirmed that they are keen to support the democratic process, and they will accept any results of the elections and deal with any government that respects human rights and the rights of women and minorities and the democratic process,” said Essam el-Erian, a veteran Brotherhood leader and the vice chairman of its new party, who met with Mr. Walles. “And we are keen and eager to say that we respect the democratic process and the rights of all people according to the Constitution and the law.”    Administration officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private diplomatic exchanges, said they hoped that a combination of internal and external pressure on the council would persuade it to yield power and submit to civilian oversight. In addition to the public comments by Mrs. Clinton, other senior American officials have privately urged the council to revise its recent proposals to preserve power, the officials said.    The officials noted that since Mr. Mubarak’s ouster, the council’s leaders had repeatedly offered, then backed away from, some proposals only after street protests and public pressure, in a kind of prolonged back-and-forth that some noted reflected a true, if messy, democratic process taking root.    But administration officials and Egyptian activists note worrying signs. The military core of Mr. Mubarak’s government has “reasserted itself again,” a senior administration official said. “We don’t have great expectations that this is going to be the creation of a democratic system,” the official said, referring to the coming elections.    At best, the official added, the elections will be “a transition to a transition,” one that could leave the military as the de facto power in Egypt for years to come, as it was under Mr. Mubarak’s rule.    The military has said that it intends to hold ultimate political power even after the election of a Parliament in the coming months, and that it will play a role in drafting the constitution as well. It has refused to lift the Mubarak-era “emergency law” allowing arrests without trial, and it has sent as many as 12,000 civilians to military trials.    While the administration’s changes in tone risk upsetting a pivotal ally where anti-American sentiment — and, in some quarters, support for the military — runs high, they are also drawing rare praise from activists here who say they appreciate Washington’s help.    “I think that Secretary of State Mrs. Clinton delivered a clear-cut message to the SCAF, and I think they got that message: that the SCAF is not an elected body and must deliver the authority and turn over power,” said Emad Gad, an analyst at the government-financed Al Ahram research institute and now a leader of the Social Democratic Party.    Mr. Gad contended that over the long term such pressure could only benefit the American relationship with a democratic Egypt. “I think more than 50 percent of the Egyptians think the SCAF is trying to kill the Egyptian revolution,” he said.           \fArticle 2.   NYT   Europe’s Contagion   Editorial      November 16, 2011 -- Two years of gross mismanagement of the euro-zone debt crisis have all too predictably produced a wider crisis of market confidence that now threatens the entire 17-nation euro zone. This week’s formation of new technocrat-led governments in Greece and Italy has not calmed fears. Practically every euro zone country is paying the price in higher interest costs and ebbing economic growth.    The only country that isn’t suffering — yet — is Germany, whose competitive export-driven economy feeds on foreign demand and an exchange rate held down by its neighbors’ troubles. But all European countries cannot be Germany and run net surpluses, especially if Berlin insists on policies that keep factories shuttered and workers unemployed.    And German leaders are wrong if they think their country will remain unscathed as its major trading partners and neighbors unravel.    Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany has been talking a more pro-European line. But she is still insisting on growth-killing austerity as the price for European bailouts and still blocking the European Central Bank from printing more euros and acting as a lender of last resort.    Mrs. Merkel’s advisers insist that she is doing what the German people want. That is not leadership. She needs to challenge her voters simplistic stereotypes of southern European sloth and tell them the truth: The real threat to Germany isn’t inflation; it is an economic collapse across Europe. And Germany has a huge amount to lose from a fracturing of the European Union.    European stock and bond markets are already treating that as an ever-more-realistic possibility, shunning even moderate levels of risk and pushing interest rates to unsustainable levels. As far as they can see, Mrs. Merkel and her fellow euro-zone leaders haven’t come up with an adequate plan, sufficient political will or sufficient cash to halt the contagion. As far as we can see, they are right.    The political changes at the top of Greece and Italy are promising. Greece’s new prime minister, Lucas Papademos, and Mario Monti of Italy are internationally credible economists, committed to making painful but much needed reforms, including liberalizing labor markets, shrinking overgrown bureaucracies, shedding state properties and rooting out corruption.    Given their training, they surely understand that their economies are not now strong enough to absorb more austerity, including broad new taxes or further sweeping service cuts. Mr. Papademos and Mr. Monti should press their fellow European leaders for a new and better deal. Even with the best leadership, neither Greece nor Italy will be able, on their own, to restore their fiscal health and help slow the spreading financial contagion. That will require substantial and immediate help from their euro-zone partners, starting with Mrs. Merkel.    An all-out effort by the European Central Bank to buy bonds, lower interest rates and inject new liquidity into the markets may still calm the contagion if it begins in the next few days. The bank’s new president, Mario Draghi, may be willing to play this role, if Germany stops standing in the way.    Mrs. Merkel must make clear that she will support the central bank taking on this expanded role. And now that new, credible leaders are in office in Athens and Rome, she and other euro-zone leaders need to meet with them and negotiate more growth-friendly reform packages. There is very little time left to avoid financial catastrophe.     \fArticle 3.   New York Post   High stakes in Syria   Amir Taheri      November 16, 2011 -- As Arab foreign ministers met in Rabat, Morocco, yesterday to discuss Syria, one question was on every mind: Is the country already in a civil war?   Some of the facts on the ground suggest so. With more than 350 killed so far, November has been the bloodiest month since the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad began last spring.   Defections from the army, which started as a trickle, now look like a torrent. In October, the number was around 800. The best total now available is about 17,000. The defectors have organized themselves as the Free Syrian Army and are creating credible command-and-control structures.   Since September, the FSA has carried out a number of symbolic attacks against the regime. And now the “shadow army,” as Syrians call it, seems to be planning more spectacular operations.   On Monday, the FSA claimed an attack on an army convoy near Deraa, the southwestern town where the revolution started. Official accounts reported at least 34 soldiers killed.   Yesterday, the FSA attacked the headquarters of the Air Force Intelligence Agency at Harasta near the capital Damascus. Since Hafez al-Assad, an air-force officer and Bashar’s father, seized power in a coup in 1970, the AIA has been the nerve center of the regime’s security system.   Also this week, reports surfaced of attacks by armed tribesmen on three military outposts near the Iraqi border.   Despite all that, it may be premature to speak of civil war in Syria.    In a civil war, a society is divided into armed camps that, initially at least, are roughly the same size. That’s not the case in Syria, where the uprising is backed by an overwhelming majority against a government that’s dominated by a small minority — the Ba’ath Party. To make matters worse, the Ba’ath is dominated by the Nusairi (Alawite) religious minority, a mere 5 percent of the population.   Thus, Syria’s is a nationwide revolution against a minority regime.   Almost all Syrians agree that the situation is untenable. Assad’s policy of rule by massacre has few supporters outside his clan. Judging by the revolution’s most popular slogan — “Assad Get Out!”— a majority may support demands for Assad to stand down, as suggested by Jordan’s King Abdullah.   Nevertheless, the Assad clan still controls enough military and financial assets to continue its rule-by-massacre strategy.    The result could be the disintegration of the Syrian army and the emergence of armed groups beyond the control of either the government or the Syrian National Council, the opposition’s umbrella organization. That could lead to violence spilling into neighboring countries, especially Iraq and Lebanon.   Rather than speculating about a civil war, the Arab League and the international community should focus on the dangers that the Syrian situation poses for regional peace.    A Franco-British resolution on Syria won a majority at the UN Security Council last month but was killed by Russian and Chinese vetoes. The Security Council should take up the issue again — this time to debate the threat to the region.   Last month, Russia and China tried to justify their vetoes by claiming that the Arab states were divided over Syria. This wasn’t true then and is less so now. The Arab League has suspended Syria’s membership and condemned the rule-by-massacre policy. Arab support is also building up for creating havens for Syrian refugees in Turkey, Lebanon, Iraq and Jordan.   Moscow had also expressed concern that, with Assad’s demise, a new Syrian government might “ignore Russia’s interests in the Middle East.” Since the vetoes, however, the Syrian National Council has established contact with Russia and China to offer assurances that a democratic Syria would pursue “cooperation with all nations.”   SNC sources tell me that they’ve also “opened a dialogue” with Iran, Assad’s main supporter, amid signs that it, too, may no longer be so sure about the despot’s chances of survival.   America must take the lead in mobilizing international support for the Syrian revolution. By removing one of the last regimes that still sponsors terrorism, the victory of democracy in Syria is in America’s best national interests.                    \fArticle 4.   Guardian   Turkey has a key role in Syria – now and in the future   Simon Tisdall       16 November 2011 -- The Arab League's unexpectedly tough action in suspending Syria, ostracising President Bashar al-Assad, and inviting opposition leaders to talks in Cairo has outraged the regime in Damascus, which suspects a US-led conspiracy to impose forcible regime change. But the increased hostility exhibited by Turkey, Syria's most powerful and best-connected neighbour, may yet prove decisive as Ankara assumes a crisis leadership role.   Until the uprising tore apart old certainties, the Turkish prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, had invested considerable capital in improved ties with Syria, with which Turkey almost went to war in the 1990s. A turning point came with the 2004 free trade agreement. This interdependence now gives Turkey significant economic leverage. Ankara has already imposed unilateral sanctions and is considering additional measures including a cut in electricity supplies.   Erdogan turned the screw again this week, accusing Assad personally of \"feeding on blood\" after he failed to honour the Arab League peace plan. \"No regime can survive by killing or jailing,\" he said. \"No one can build a future over the blood of the oppressed.\"   Turkey's motives are not difficult to discern. Chaos on its fragile southern flank, and Syria's possible descent into civil war, would be reasons enough to prompt Ankara's intervention. But Erdogan was also incensed by weekend attacks on Turkey's embassy in Damascus and regional consulates, apparently orchestrated by the regime. The government issued a formal protest and advised Turks against travel to Syria, a reversal of its proud open-borders policy.   Turkey also appears motivated by a desire to keep ahead of evolving Arab opinion. \"It can comfortably be said, in light of recent developments, that the countdown to the end of Syria's Assad regime has begun,\" said Today's Zaman columnist Bülent Kenes, reflecting official opinion.   With senior Saudi officials and King Abdullah of Jordan openly backing the revolt, and the violence escalating, Erdogan and his foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, who have long harboured regional leadership ambitions, seem to be positioning themselves for a post-Assad future.   In this push towards the Syrian endgame they plainly have the enthusiastic backing of the US, for whom they are effectively acting as a local proxy in opposition to external actors such as the pro-regime Russia. Given Erdogan's sharp differences with Washington over Israel-Palestine and the Iraq war, this coincidence of view is not lacking in irony. \"We very much welcome the strong stance that Turkey has taken and believe it sends a critical message to President Assad that … he should step down,\" said Ben Rhodes, Barack Obama's deputy national security adviser.   In a series of statements, Davutoglu has insisted it is \"no longer possible to trust the Syrian government\". Adding provocation to insult, he underscored Ankara's support for the protesters and specifically for the Syrian National Council, an opposition umbrella group based in Turkey that is seeking recognition from Ankara. \"We will continue to take our place at the side of the Syrian people's rightful struggle,\" Davutoglu said.   As bilateral tensions rise, suggestions that Turkey may physically intervene in northern Syria to create a safe haven for civilians displaced by the violence are likely to resurface. Several thousand Syrian refugees are already sheltering inside Turkey, as are numerous Syrian army defectors. Possibly anticipating Syrian retaliation, the newspaper Hürriyet reported that President Abdullah Gül recently warned Assad would pay a heavy price for stirring up trouble in Turkey's Kurdish south-east.   Fears that a Syrian meltdown could seriously destabilise the wider neighbourhood are also driving Turkey's hardening response. Such a scenario could affect Iraq, where security concerns are rising as the US withdrawal nears completion, and even Iran, a close Assad ally.   For its part, the Syrian regime has pressing reasons to fear Ankara's animosity, as Gökhan Bacik pointed out in Today's Zaman. Unlike many Muslim countries, Turkey identifies strongly with Europe, the US and Nato. And in the past decade, Erdogan's Justice and Development party has made its brand of moderate Islamist politics acceptable to previously blinkered western eyes.   In other words, Turkey, with its majority Sunni Muslim population, furnishes a role model for the disenfranchised Sunni majority in Syria (and other Arab spring countries). Not only is Ankara encouraging revolution in Damascus, it is also living proof that Assad's politics of fear are outdated, that Syrians have before them a workable alternative paradigm, and that, after the revolution, the country's secular, Islamist and other sectarian traditions could fairly hope to co-exist peacefully, Turkish-style.               \fArticle 5.   Foreign Policy   Barack Obama's Foreign Policy   November 16, 2011     Foreign-policy credentials: As president, Obama has taken on a number of major foreign-policy initiatives, including a renewed troop surge in Afghanistan, the negotiation of the New START nuclear arms reduction treaty with Russia, the NATO intervention in Libya, the withdrawal from Iraq, ongoing trade negotiations with China, and of course, the killing of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.     Overview: Obama is a much different candidate today from the senator who distinguished himself by his opposition to the \"dumb war\" on his way to the presidency in 2008. Obama has turned out, in many ways, to have pursued a fairly conventional, at times, hawkish foreign policy. He has had some notable successes, such as the bin Laden raid and this year's withdrawal from Iraq -- albeit on a timetable negotiated by his predecessor -- and the successful overthrow of Muammar al-Qaddafi. All the same, \"apology tours\" and \"leading from behind\" -- referring to an unfortunate description of Obama's diplomatic strategy by a White House staffer -- have already become buzzwords for Republican candidates. He has also faced heavy criticism on the left for a sometimes inconsistent approach to international law in counterterrorism operations.      But with a significant economic recovery appearing unlikely and fewer domestic achievements to point to than he might have expected, coupled with the international inexperience of his opponents, Obama may make his foreign-policy wins the centerpiece of his reelection strategy.      Advisors: Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, National Security Advisor Thomas Donilon.      On the issues:      Afghanistan/Pakistan: \"We have put al Qaeda on a path to defeat,\" Obama announced last June, noting that the 33,000 \"surge\" troops he sent to Afghanistan in 2009 would be out of the country by the summer of 2012. Although a constant barrage of drone strikes and special operations raids have taken a harsh toll on al Qaeda, it may be difficult for Obama to make the case that Afghanistan has achieved stability or that Hamid Karzai's government can stand on its own without U.S. assistance.      Relations with Pakistan have deteriorated significantly under Obama's tenure, particularly following the bin Laden raid. He has pledged to \"constantly evaluate\" the relationship between the two countries going forward but says he would be hesitant to cut off aid that could \"help the Pakistani people strengthen their own society and their own government.\"      Military spending: Backed by his then current defense secretary, Robert Gates, Obama announced last April that the Pentagon will lead a \"fundamental review\" of U.S. military capabilities in order to cut $400 billion in defense spending over the next 10 years. \"We need to not only eliminate waste and improve efficiency and effectiveness, but conduct a fundamental review of America's missions, capabilities, and our role in a changing world,\" Obama said. Of course, major cuts could come sooner than that if the congressional \"supercommittee\" fails to reach an agreement on deficit reduction by Nov. 23.      Immigration/borders: Obama insists that enacting comprehensive immigration reform, which would likely include a path to citizenship for at least some illegal immigrants already in the United States, is still a \"top priority,\" but with little congressional enthusiasm for such a measure, it has been pushed to the back burner for now. Meanwhile, deportations of illegal immigrants are continuing at a record pace, though the administration touts the fact that a higher percentage of those deported have criminal records.      Obama has substantially increased the number of agents patrolling the U.S.-Mexico border, but has also mocked the fence-building enthusiasm of Republicans, saying they won't be happy until there's a \"moat with alligators.\"      Israel/Palestine: Obama's engagement in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process has probably been the most frustrating foreign-policy initiative of his presidency and the one on which he is most often criticized by his Republican opponents. Obama continues to support negotiations on a two-state settlement of the conflict, but his best-remembered statement on the topic is controversial: his suggestion that Israel's pre-1967 war borders be taken as a starting point for negotiations, a position fiercely opposed by Israel. More recently, the administration has confirmed that it will veto Palestine's statehood bid in the U.N. Security Council.      Obama's relationship with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has seemed very strained at times. In a recently overheard conversation he told French President Nicolas Sarkozy, \"You're fed up with him? I have to deal with him every day.\"      China: Obama has repeatedly criticized China -- most recently at the APEC summit in Honolulu -- for currency policies that he says have a distorting effect on the global economy. The president has made a few cautious statements on China's human rights record but came under criticism for delaying a White House meeting with the Dalai Lama. This year, the administration confirmed a $5.8 billion package of arms sales for Taiwan that provoked a predictable Chinese backlash.      Foreign aid: In his 2010 address to the U.N. General Assembly, Obama announced an overhaul of U.S. foreign aid policies, which he vowed will place them at the center of U.S. foreign policy. In the speech he called aid a \"core pillar of American power.\" Nonetheless, foreign aid to a number of countries was cut by Congress in the 2012 budget.      Iran/nukes: Early in his presidency, Obama made several overtures to Iran in an effort to improve relations. Critics say this engagement strategy went too far during the 2009 Green Movement uprising against the reelection of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, when the Obama administration was reluctant to overtly back the protesters. Since then, the administration has instituted a number of new sanctions against Iran that are aimed at halting its nuclear enrichment program. \"We are not taking any options off the table. Iran with nuclear weapons would pose a threat not only to the region but also to the United States,\" Obama said in a recent news conference in Hawaii.      Trade: In October, Obama signed long-delayed free trade agreements with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea. On his trip to Asia this November, Obama is working to promote a new trans-Pacific free trade agreement. \"We're not going to be able to put our folks back to work and grow our economy and expand opportunity unless the Asia-Pacific region is also successful,\" he said. Obama has indefinitely put on hold a campaign promise to renegotiate NAFTA.      War on terror/detainees: Obama signed an executive order closing the Guantánamo Bay detention center as one of his first actions as president. The facility remains open, however, largely due to congressional opposition over where to house the remaining prisoners. Obama has put a halt to the \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" employed by George W. Bush's administration but has enraged some civil liberties advocates by authorizing the extrajudicial killing of alleged al Qaeda terrorist Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen. Obama has also disappointed some liberal supporters by resuming military trials of terrorism suspects at Guantánamo.      Environment: Despite his stated support for environmental legislation and green energy, there has been little progress on passing major climate-change bills under Obama's watch. Thanks largely to Obama's public intervention, an agreement was reached at the 2009 Copenhagen climate summit, but in failing to impose enforceable emissions targets, the meeting was widely considered a failure. This year, Obama abandoned tough new air-quality rules, adopted early in his administration.      Russia/reset: One of the centerpieces of Obama's first-term foreign policy was the effort to \"reset\" relations with Russia. The president successfully negotiated the New START nuclear reduction treaty, though there have been significant disagreements with both Russia and his GOP opponents over the contours of missile defense. Human rights advocates have criticized the president for ignoring the erosion of Russian democracy. Russia has also continued to stymie U.S. efforts to impose tough international sanctions on Iran and Syria. Obama seemed to have made friends with President Dmitry Medvedev, but relations with Russia may only get tougher, with Vladimir Putin's likely return to the Russian presidency.      Arab Spring: After a slow start, the Obama administration eventually came around to calling for Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to step down, joining the NATO intervention in Libya, and supporting stricter sanctions against Syria. The president has been less outspoken about other Persian Gulf allies, including Bahrain, which hosts a key U.S. naval base. Obama has urged Egypt and Tunisia to \"set a strong example through free and fair elections, a vibrant civil society, accountable and effective democratic institutions, and responsible regional leadership.\"      Other issues: Although he once described himself as a George H.W. Bush-school realist, in the past year Obama has learned to embrace humanitarian intervention, both in Libya and in central Africa, where military advisors have been sent to aid in the fight against the long-running insurgency by the Lord's Resistance Army. There's speculation that Nigeria may be next. It's a measure of how much things have changed in the last four years that Republicans are now attacking the Democratic president for trying to spread democracy and human rights at the barrel of a gun.      As the European economic crisis has worsened, Obama has been speaking out more in support of strong measures to protect the common currency. \"Ultimately what they are going to need is a firewall that sends a clear signal we stand behind the European project and we stand behind the euro,\" he said during his recent trip to Australia.             \fArticle 6.   Project Syndicate   America in the Asian Century   Dominique Moisi      2011-11-15 – At “ground zero” in lower Manhattan, two empty spaces will be filled by water cascades, memorializing in a serene and respectful way the victims of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Next to them, a powerful tower, designed by the architect Daniel Libeskind and nearly completed, rises vigorously into the sky, a symbol of the triumph of life over the forces of death. One word comes to mind to characterize the impression made by this place, the site of an unprecedented crime: resilience.   In a building that houses what will one day be a memorial museum, one can buy a DVD entitled “9/12: From Chaos to Community.” Ground Zero is the architectural and human proof that, despite America’s current economic woes, it would be premature, if not dangerous, to write the country off as a declining power. America has the moral and intellectual resources that it needs in order to rebound.   But what is necessary is not sufficient. In order to reinvent itself, if not to manage its relative international decline, America must proceed toward a rebalancing of its domestic and international priorities. In the immediate aftermath of World War I, a triumphant America withdrew from global responsibility, with tragic consequences for the balance of power in a Europe that was left to face its inner demons alone.   In the aftermath of World War II, by contrast, the US managed successfully to contain Soviet ambitions. Today, unlike in 1945, Americans do not confront an imminent threat. Russia may speak loudly (using its permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council as a megaphone), but it is a greatly reduced rump of the Soviet Union. Likewise, while the nationalism of America’s principal rival, China, has become more assertive lately, the communist regime’s clear priority – indeed, the key to its stability – is domestic economic growth.   Indeed, the only obvious danger that the US faces stems from weapons of mass destruction, which could proliferate or be used by terrorist groups. But confronting this threat does not require a massive military budget or huge deployments of US troops all over the world. America has a much-needed opportunity to refocus on itself – to recover its inner strength without withdrawing from the world. As Richard Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, puts it, America must enter a period of “restoration” of its fundamentals.   American foreign policy starts at home, and that means reining in budget deficits over the long term, reviving economic growth and job creation in the short term, and addressing the country’s deteriorating infrastructure. Indeed, America’s “aged modernity” has become a drag on its competitiveness, as well as an insult to its international image and a risk to the safety of its citizens.   Moreover, imperial fatigue has set in. Recent US history has been characterized by cycles of enthusiasm about foreign engagement. In the mid-1970’s, following the war in Vietnam, America, guided by President Jimmy Carter’s moralizing impulse, opted for “regionalization” of its engagements. But, given that the Soviet threat still existed, this effort came too early (and probably was carried out in the wrong manner).   Today, by contrast, the starting point for a reassessment of American priorities is more economic than ethical. But the reasoning is the same, for it is based on the conviction that more America in the world today implies less costly and confused interventionism tomorrow. That means that US foreign policy itself – defined in recent years by too much attention to the Middle East, and too little to Asia – must embrace a shift in priorities.   Of course, in the midst of today’s ongoing Arab revolutions, America cannot simply ignore the Middle East. Nor must the US give up hope on the Israel-Palestine front, or on its efforts to contain Iran’s nuclear ambitions. But it is in Asia that history is unfolding – and where the US must define its long-term global strategy.   Must the US, as Henry Kissinger suggests in his latest book On China, consider the prospect of a “Pacific Community” that, unlike the Cold War-era Atlantic Community, is not based on common culture and values in the face of a direct threat, but on common interests in an “age of rebalancing of world order”?   America’s resilience may contrast with Europe’s multiple weaknesses. But resilience will not be enough. The US must get back into shape to face tomorrow’s challenges, and that means restoring economic growth, reducing deficits, and improving infrastructure. Paradoxically, only a more confident America can accept a reduced global status, because reconciling oneself to change is always easier once one has taken the steps needed to adjust to it.

Kirkpatrick and Steven Lee Myers\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 16, 2011 -- CAIRO — Brazen attempts by Egypt’s interim military rulers to hold on to power long after elections have elicited a sharp reaction domestically and for the first time have prompted Washington to warn about the potential for new unrest. \n\n\nAfter months of mixing gentle pressure with broad support for the ruling military council, the Obama administration has sharpened its tone, senior administration officials say, expressing concern that the failure to move to civilian control could undermine the defining revolt of the Arab Spring. \n\n\nThe shift in tone is part of a difficult balancing act for Washington, which is keen to preserve its ties to the military and its interests in the region, chiefly Egypt’s role in maintaining peace with Israel. But Washington also hopes to win favor with Egypt’s newly empowered political opposition while avoiding the appearance of endorsing the militarys stalled transition to democracy. All things considered, some here have suggested, the change in tone may be intended to placate Egyptian public opinion rather than actually press the military to give up power. \n\n\n“I think they are working for their own interests, particularly regarding the slow transition of power,” said Shady el-Ghazaly Harb, a prominent liberal activist who was among the leaders of the Egyptian revolution. “The U.S. wants to guarantee that the coming government will be on good terms — I won’t say loyal, but friendly — and the support for SCAF is related to that.” SCAF is the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, Egypt’s ruling military council. \n\n\nSecretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton underscored the shift in a speech last week that her aides later said was a deliberate warning to the military council, which assumed power after President Hosni Mubarak’s ouster. The military had initially pledged to hand over control to civilians by September, but it now says that a presidential election will not occur before 2013. And last week it laid out a blueprint for the next constitution, giving the military special political powers and protection from civilian oversight into perpetuity. \n\n\n“If, over time, the most powerful political force in Egypt remains a roomful of unelected officials, they will have planted the seeds for future unrest, and Egyptians will have missed a historic opportunity,” Mrs. Clinton warned. \n\n\n“When unelected authorities say they want to be out of the business of governing,” the United States expects them “to lay out a clear road map” and “abide by it,” she added. \n\n\nGiven Washington’s long support for Mr. Mubarak, and Mrs. Clinton’s comment last month approving of the military’s extended timetable for electing a civilian president, there was suspicion over Washington’s intentions. The shift occurred at the same time as a broader effort by the Obama administration to counter anti-American sentiment and reach out to opposition leaders across the political spectrum. \n\n\nThe United States “wants to have the cake and eat it, too,” said Nabil Fahmy, a former Egyptian ambassador to Washington, arguing that the United States wants to promote democracy without dealing with the pressure it would put on American interests in the region. \n\n\nThe military’s attempts to protect its power and privileges indefinitely have created an awkward situation for Washington. The United States, through the Pentagon in particular, has long nurtured close ties with the Egyptian military, which still receives $1.3 billion in American aid each year. American officials hope that whatever government emerges will continue to support American policy, including maintaining ties with Israel and distance from Iran. \n\n\nAt the same time, the United States’ standing in public opinion in Egypt and around the region continues to suffer because of decades of support for undemocratic governments like the military-backed system that controlled Egypt under Mr. Mubarak. Remaining aloof from the debate over the military’s future role here risks reinforcing those criticisms at a time when democratic changes are giving public opinion new weight. \n\n\nAs part of its broader outreach, the Obama administration has also met with the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist group whose political party is poised to win a major role in the country’s new Parliament and remains the biggest political counterweight to the military council. \n\n\nJacob Walles, a deputy assistant secretary of state, met for the first time this week with the leaders of the Brotherhood’s newly formed Freedom and Justice Party at its new headquarters in Cairo. While American diplomats have had intermittent contacts for years with Brotherhood lawmakers in the Egyptian Parliament, officials here said Mr. Walles’s meeting appeared to underscore Mrs. Clinton’s pledges to cooperate with Islamist parties that respect democracy. \n\n\nOthers said it might instead have been a sign that Washington simply realized that the Brotherhood was certain to play a crucial role in Egypt’s future and was likely to win a large bloc of seats in the parliamentary elections that begin this month. \n\n\n“They confirmed that they are keen to support the democratic process, and they will accept any results of the elections and deal with any government that respects human rights and the rights of women and minorities and the democratic process,” said Essam el-Erian, a veteran Brotherhood leader and the vice chairman of its new party, who met with Mr. Walles. “And we are keen and eager to say that we respect the democratic process and the rights of all people according to the Constitution and the law.” \n\n\nAdministration officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private diplomatic exchanges, said they hoped that a combination of internal and external pressure on the council would persuade it to yield power and submit to civilian oversight. In addition to the public comments by Mrs. Clinton, other senior American officials have privately urged the council to revise its recent proposals to preserve power, the officials said. \n\n\nThe officials noted that since Mr. Mubarak’s ouster, the council’s leaders had repeatedly offered, then backed away from, some proposals only after street protests and public pressure, in a kind of prolonged back-and-forth that some noted reflected a true, if messy, democratic process taking root. \n\n\nBut administration officials and Egyptian activists note worrying signs. The military core of Mr. Mubarak’s government has “reasserted itself again,” a senior administration official said. “We don’t have great expectations that this is going to be the creation of a democratic system,” the official said, referring to the coming elections. \n\n\nAt best, the official added, the elections will be “a transition to a transition,” one that could leave the military as the de facto power in Egypt for years to come, as it was under Mr. Mubarak’s rule. \n\n\nThe military has said that it intends to hold ultimate political power even after the election of a Parliament in the coming months, and that it will play a role in drafting the constitution as well. It has refused to lift the Mubarak-era “emergency law” allowing arrests without trial, and it has sent as many as 12,000 civilians to military trials. \n\n\nWhile the administration’s changes in tone risk upsetting a pivotal ally where anti-American sentiment — and, in some quarters, support for the military — runs high, they are also drawing rare praise from activists here who say they appreciate Washington’s help. \n\n\n“I think that Secretary of State Mrs. Clinton delivered a clear-cut message to the SCAF, and I think they got that message: that the SCAF is not an elected body and must deliver the authority and turn over power,” said Emad Gad, an analyst at the government-financed Al Ahram research institute and now a leader of the Social Democratic Party. \n\n\nMr. Gad contended that over the long term such pressure could only benefit the American relationship with a democratic Egypt. “I think more than 50 percent of the Egyptians think the SCAF is trying to kill the Egyptian revolution,” he said. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\fArticle 2.\n\n\nNYT\n\n\nEurope’s Contagion\n\n\nEditorial\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 16, 2011 -- Two years of gross mismanagement of the euro-zone debt crisis have all too predictably produced a wider crisis of market confidence that now threatens the entire 17-nation euro zone. This week’s formation of new technocrat-led governments in Greece and Italy has not calmed fears. Practically every euro zone country is paying the price in higher interest costs and ebbing economic growth. \n\n\nThe only country that isn’t suffering — yet — is Germany, whose competitive export-driven economy feeds on foreign demand and an exchange rate held down by its neighbors’ troubles. But all European countries cannot be Germany and run net surpluses, especially if Berlin insists on policies that keep factories shuttered and workers unemployed. \n\n\nAnd German leaders are wrong if they think their country will remain unscathed as its major trading partners and neighbors unravel. \n\n\nChancellor Angela Merkel of Germany has been talking a more pro-European line. But she is still insisting on growth-killing austerity as the price for European bailouts and still blocking the European Central Bank from printing more euros and acting as a lender of last resort. \n\n\nMrs. Merkel’s advisers insist that she is doing what the German people want. That is not leadership. She needs to challenge her voters simplistic stereotypes of southern European sloth and tell them the truth: The real threat to Germany isn’t inflation; it is an economic collapse across Europe. And Germany has a huge amount to lose from a fracturing of the European Union. \n\n\nEuropean stock and bond markets are already treating that as an ever-more-realistic possibility, shunning even moderate levels of risk and pushing interest rates to unsustainable levels. As far as they can see, Mrs. Merkel and her fellow euro-zone leaders haven’t come up with an adequate plan, sufficient political will or sufficient cash to halt the contagion. As far as we can see, they are right. \n\n\nThe political changes at the top of Greece and Italy are promising. Greece’s new prime minister, Lucas Papademos, and Mario Monti of Italy are internationally credible economists, committed to making painful but much needed reforms, including liberalizing labor markets, shrinking overgrown bureaucracies, shedding state properties and rooting out corruption. \n\n\nGiven their training, they surely understand that their economies are not now strong enough to absorb more austerity, including broad new taxes or further sweeping service cuts. Mr. Papademos and Mr. Monti should press their fellow European leaders for a new and better deal. Even with the best leadership, neither Greece nor Italy will be able, on their own, to restore their fiscal health and help slow the spreading financial contagion. That will require substantial and immediate help from their euro-zone partners, starting with Mrs. Merkel. \n\n\nAn all-out effort by the European Central Bank to buy bonds, lower interest rates and inject new liquidity into the markets may still calm the contagion if it begins in the next few days. The bank’s new president, Mario Draghi, may be willing to play this role, if Germany stops standing in the way. \n\n\nMrs. Merkel must make clear that she will support the central bank taking on this expanded role. And now that new, credible leaders are in office in Athens and Rome, she and other euro-zone leaders need to meet with them and negotiate more growth-friendly reform packages. There is very little time left to avoid financial catastrophe. \n\n\n\n\fArticle 3.\n\n\nNew York Post\n\n\nHigh stakes in Syria\n\n\nAmir Taheri\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 16, 2011 -- As Arab foreign ministers met in Rabat, Morocco, yesterday to discuss Syria, one question was on every mind: Is the country already in a civil war?\n\n\nSome of the facts on the ground suggest so. With more than 350 killed so far, November has been the bloodiest month since the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad began last spring.\n\n\nDefections from the army, which started as a trickle, now look like a torrent. In October, the number was around 800. The best total now available is about 17,000. The defectors have organized themselves as the Free Syrian Army and are creating credible command-and-control structures.\n\n\nSince September, the FSA has carried out a number of symbolic attacks against the regime. And now the “shadow army,” as Syrians call it, seems to be planning more spectacular operations.\n\n\nOn Monday, the FSA claimed an attack on an army convoy near Deraa, the southwestern town where the revolution started. Official accounts reported at least 34 soldiers killed.\n\n\nYesterday, the FSA attacked the headquarters of the Air Force Intelligence Agency at Harasta near the capital Damascus. Since Hafez al-Assad, an air-force officer and Bashar’s father, seized power in a coup in 1970, the AIA has been the nerve center of the regime’s security system.\n\n\nAlso this week, reports surfaced of attacks by armed tribesmen on three military outposts near the Iraqi border.\n\n\nDespite all that, it may be premature to speak of civil war in Syria. \n\n\nIn a civil war, a society is divided into armed camps that, initially at least, are roughly the same size. That’s not the case in Syria, where the uprising is backed by an overwhelming majority against a government that’s dominated by a small minority — the Ba’ath Party. To make matters worse, the Ba’ath is dominated by the Nusairi (Alawite) religious minority, a mere 5 percent of the population.\n\n\nThus, Syria’s is a nationwide revolution against a minority regime.\n\n\nAlmost all Syrians agree that the situation is untenable. Assad’s policy of rule by massacre has few supporters outside his clan. Judging by the revolution’s most popular slogan — “Assad Get Out!”— a majority may support demands for Assad to stand down, as suggested by Jordan’s King Abdullah.\n\n\nNevertheless, the Assad clan still controls enough military and financial assets to continue its rule-by-massacre strategy. \n\n\nThe result could be the disintegration of the Syrian army and the emergence of armed groups beyond the control of either the government or the Syrian National Council, the opposition’s umbrella organization. That could lead to violence spilling into neighboring countries, especially Iraq and Lebanon.\n\n\nRather than speculating about a civil war, the Arab League and the international community should focus on the dangers that the Syrian situation poses for regional peace. \n\n\nA Franco-British resolution on Syria won a majority at the UN Security Council last month but was killed by Russian and Chinese vetoes. The Security Council should take up the issue again — this time to debate the threat to the region.\n\n\nLast month, Russia and China tried to justify their vetoes by claiming that the Arab states were divided over Syria. This wasn’t true then and is less so now. The Arab League has suspended Syria’s membership and condemned the rule-by-massacre policy. Arab support is also building up for creating havens for Syrian refugees in Turkey, Lebanon, Iraq and Jordan.\n\n\nMoscow had also expressed concern that, with Assad’s demise, a new Syrian government might “ignore Russia’s interests in the Middle East.” Since the vetoes, however, the Syrian National Council has established contact with Russia and China to offer assurances that a democratic Syria would pursue “cooperation with all nations.”\n\n\nSNC sources tell me that they’ve also “opened a dialogue” with Iran, Assad’s main supporter, amid signs that it, too, may no longer be so sure about the despot’s chances of survival.\n\n\nAmerica must take the lead in mobilizing international support for the Syrian revolution. By removing one of the last regimes that still sponsors terrorism, the victory of democracy in Syria is in America’s best national interests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\fArticle 4.\n\n\nGuardian\n\n\nTurkey has a key role in Syria – now and in the future\n\n\nSimon Tisdall \n\n\n\n\n\n16 November 2011 -- The Arab League's unexpectedly tough action in suspending Syria, ostracising President Bashar al-Assad, and inviting opposition leaders to talks in Cairo has outraged the regime in Damascus, which suspects a US-led conspiracy to impose forcible regime change. But the increased hostility exhibited by Turkey, Syria's most powerful and best-connected neighbour, may yet prove decisive as Ankara assumes a crisis leadership role.\n\n\nUntil the uprising tore apart old certainties, the Turkish prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, had invested considerable capital in improved ties with Syria, with which Turkey almost went to war in the 1990s. A turning point came with the 2004 free trade agreement. This interdependence now gives Turkey significant economic leverage. Ankara has already imposed unilateral sanctions and is considering additional measures including a cut in electricity supplies.\n\n\nErdogan turned the screw again this week, accusing Assad personally of \"feeding on blood\" after he failed to honour the Arab League peace plan. \"No regime can survive by killing or jailing,\" he said. \"No one can build a future over the blood of the oppressed.\"\n\n\nTurkey's motives are not difficult to discern. Chaos on its fragile southern flank, and Syria's possible descent into civil war, would be reasons enough to prompt Ankara's intervention. But Erdogan was also incensed by weekend attacks on Turkey's embassy in Damascus and regional consulates, apparently orchestrated by the regime. The government issued a formal protest and advised Turks against travel to Syria, a reversal of its proud open-borders policy.\n\n\nTurkey also appears motivated by a desire to keep ahead of evolving Arab opinion. \"It can comfortably be said, in light of recent developments, that the countdown to the end of Syria's Assad regime has begun,\" said Today's Zaman columnist Bülent Kenes, reflecting official opinion.\n\n\nWith senior Saudi officials and King Abdullah of Jordan openly backing the revolt, and the violence escalating, Erdogan and his foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, who have long harboured regional leadership ambitions, seem to be positioning themselves for a post-Assad future.\n\n\nIn this push towards the Syrian endgame they plainly have the enthusiastic backing of the US, for whom they are effectively acting as a local proxy in opposition to external actors such as the pro-regime Russia. Given Erdogan's sharp differences with Washington over Israel-Palestine and the Iraq war, this coincidence of view is not lacking in irony. \"We very much welcome the strong stance that Turkey has taken and believe it sends a critical message to President Assad that … he should step down,\" said Ben Rhodes, Barack Obama's deputy national security adviser.\n\n\nIn a series of statements, Davutoglu has insisted it is \"no longer possible to trust the Syrian government\". Adding provocation to insult, he underscored Ankara's support for the protesters and specifically for the Syrian National Council, an opposition umbrella group based in Turkey that is seeking recognition from Ankara. \"We will continue to take our place at the side of the Syrian people's rightful struggle,\" Davutoglu said.\n\n\nAs bilateral tensions rise, suggestions that Turkey may physically intervene in northern Syria to create a safe haven for civilians displaced by the violence are likely to resurface. Several thousand Syrian refugees are already sheltering inside Turkey, as are numerous Syrian army defectors. Possibly anticipating Syrian retaliation, the newspaper Hürriyet reported that President Abdullah Gül recently warned Assad would pay a heavy price for stirring up trouble in Turkey's Kurdish south-east.\n\n\nFears that a Syrian meltdown could seriously destabilise the wider neighbourhood are also driving Turkey's hardening response. Such a scenario could affect Iraq, where security concerns are rising as the US withdrawal nears completion, and even Iran, a close Assad ally.\n\n\nFor its part, the Syrian regime has pressing reasons to fear Ankara's animosity, as Gökhan Bacik pointed out in Today's Zaman. Unlike many Muslim countries, Turkey identifies strongly with Europe, the US and Nato. And in the past decade, Erdogan's Justice and Development party has made its brand of moderate Islamist politics acceptable to previously blinkered western eyes.\n\n\nIn other words, Turkey, with its majority Sunni Muslim population, furnishes a role model for the disenfranchised Sunni majority in Syria (and other Arab spring countries). Not only is Ankara encouraging revolution in Damascus, it is also living proof that Assad's politics of fear are outdated, that Syrians have before them a workable alternative paradigm, and that, after the revolution, the country's secular, Islamist and other sectarian traditions could fairly hope to co-exist peacefully, Turkish-style.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\fArticle 5.\n\n\nForeign Policy\n\n\nBarack Obama's Foreign Policy\n\n\nNovember 16, 2011 \n\n\n\nForeign-policy credentials: As president, Obama has taken on a number of major foreign-policy initiatives, including a renewed troop surge in Afghanistan, the negotiation of the New START nuclear arms reduction treaty with Russia, the NATO intervention in Libya, the withdrawal from Iraq, ongoing trade negotiations with China, and of course, the killing of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. \n\n\n\nOverview: Obama is a much different candidate today from the senator who distinguished himself by his opposition to the \"dumb war\" on his way to the presidency in 2008. Obama has turned out, in many ways, to have pursued a fairly conventional, at times, hawkish foreign policy. He has had some notable successes, such as the bin Laden raid and this year's withdrawal from Iraq -- albeit on a timetable negotiated by his predecessor -- and the successful overthrow of Muammar al-Qaddafi. All the same, \"apology tours\" and \"leading from behind\" -- referring to an unfortunate description of Obama's diplomatic strategy by a White House staffer -- have already become buzzwords for Republican candidates. He has also faced heavy criticism on the left for a sometimes inconsistent approach to international law in counterterrorism operations. \n\n\n\n\nBut with a significant economic recovery appearing unlikely and fewer domestic achievements to point to than he might have expected, coupled with the international inexperience of his opponents, Obama may make his foreign-policy wins the centerpiece of his reelection strategy. \n\n\n\n\nAdvisors: Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, National Security Advisor Thomas Donilon. \n\n\n\n\nOn the issues: \n\n\n\n\nAfghanistan/Pakistan: \"We have put al Qaeda on a path to defeat,\" Obama announced last June, noting that the 33,000 \"surge\" troops he sent to Afghanistan in 2009 would be out of the country by the summer of 2012. Although a constant barrage of drone strikes and special operations raids have taken a harsh toll on al Qaeda, it may be difficult for Obama to make the case that Afghanistan has achieved stability or that Hamid Karzai's government can stand on its own without U.S. assistance. \n\n\n\n\nRelations with Pakistan have deteriorated significantly under Obama's tenure, particularly following the bin Laden raid. He has pledged to \"constantly evaluate\" the relationship between the two countries going forward but says he would be hesitant to cut off aid that could \"help the Pakistani people strengthen their own society and their own government.\" \n\n\n\n\nMilitary spending: Backed by his then current defense secretary, Robert Gates, Obama announced last April that the Pentagon will lead a \"fundamental review\" of U.S. military capabilities in order to cut $400 billion in defense spending over the next 10 years. \"We need to not only eliminate waste and improve efficiency and effectiveness, but conduct a fundamental review of America's missions, capabilities, and our role in a changing world,\" Obama said. Of course, major cuts could come sooner than that if the congressional \"supercommittee\" fails to reach an agreement on deficit reduction by Nov. 23. \n\n\n\n\nImmigration/borders: Obama insists that enacting comprehensive immigration reform, which would likely include a path to citizenship for at least some illegal immigrants already in the United States, is still a \"top priority,\" but with little congressional enthusiasm for such a measure, it has been pushed to the back burner for now. Meanwhile, deportations of illegal immigrants are continuing at a record pace, though the administration touts the fact that a higher percentage of those deported have criminal records. \n\n\n\n\nObama has substantially increased the number of agents patrolling the U.S.-Mexico border, but has also mocked the fence-building enthusiasm of Republicans, saying they won't be happy until there's a \"moat with alligators.\" \n\n\n\n\nIsrael/Palestine: Obama's engagement in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process has probably been the most frustrating foreign-policy initiative of his presidency and the one on which he is most often criticized by his Republican opponents. Obama continues to support negotiations on a two-state settlement of the conflict, but his best-remembered statement on the topic is controversial: his suggestion that Israel's pre-1967 war borders be taken as a starting point for negotiations, a position fiercely opposed by Israel. More recently, the administration has confirmed that it will veto Palestine's statehood bid in the U.N. Security Council. \n\n\n\n\nObama's relationship with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has seemed very strained at times. In a recently overheard conversation he told French President Nicolas Sarkozy, \"You're fed up with him? I have to deal with him every day.\" \n\n\n\n\nChina: Obama has repeatedly criticized China -- most recently at the APEC summit in Honolulu -- for currency policies that he says have a distorting effect on the global economy. The president has made a few cautious statements on China's human rights record but came under criticism for delaying a White House meeting with the Dalai Lama. This year, the administration confirmed a $5.8 billion package of arms sales for Taiwan that provoked a predictable Chinese backlash. \n\n\n\n\nForeign aid: In his 2010 address to the U.N. General Assembly, Obama announced an overhaul of U.S. foreign aid policies, which he vowed will place them at the center of U.S. foreign policy. In the speech he called aid a \"core pillar of American power.\" Nonetheless, foreign aid to a number of countries was cut by Congress in the 2012 budget. \n\n\n\n\nIran/nukes: Early in his presidency, Obama made several overtures to Iran in an effort to improve relations. Critics say this engagement strategy went too far during the 2009 Green Movement uprising against the reelection of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, when the Obama administration was reluctant to overtly back the protesters. Since then, the administration has instituted a number of new sanctions against Iran that are aimed at halting its nuclear enrichment program. \"We are not taking any options off the table. Iran with nuclear weapons would pose a threat not only to the region but also to the United States,\" Obama said in a recent news conference in Hawaii. \n\n\n\n\nTrade: In October, Obama signed long-delayed free trade agreements with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea. On his trip to Asia this November, Obama is working to promote a new trans-Pacific free trade agreement. \"We're not going to be able to put our folks back to work and grow our economy and expand opportunity unless the Asia-Pacific region is also successful,\" he said. Obama has indefinitely put on hold a campaign promise to renegotiate NAFTA. \n\n\n\n\nWar on terror/detainees: Obama signed an executive order closing the Guantánamo Bay detention center as one of his first actions as president. The facility remains open, however, largely due to congressional opposition over where to house the remaining prisoners. Obama has put a halt to the \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" employed by George W. Bush's administration but has enraged some civil liberties advocates by authorizing the extrajudicial killing of alleged al Qaeda terrorist Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen. Obama has also disappointed some liberal supporters by resuming military trials of terrorism suspects at Guantánamo. \n\n\n\n\nEnvironment: Despite his stated support for environmental legislation and green energy, there has been little progress on passing major climate-change bills under Obama's watch. Thanks largely to Obama's public intervention, an agreement was reached at the 2009 Copenhagen climate summit, but in failing to impose enforceable emissions targets, the meeting was widely considered a failure. This year, Obama abandoned tough new air-quality rules, adopted early in his administration. \n\n\n\n\nRussia/reset: One of the centerpieces of Obama's first-term foreign policy was the effort to \"reset\" relations with Russia. The president successfully negotiated the New START nuclear reduction treaty, though there have been significant disagreements with both Russia and his GOP opponents over the contours of missile defense. Human rights advocates have criticized the president for ignoring the erosion of Russian democracy. Russia has also continued to stymie U.S. efforts to impose tough international sanctions on Iran and Syria. Obama seemed to have made friends with President Dmitry Medvedev, but relations with Russia may only get tougher, with Vladimir Putin's likely return to the Russian presidency. \n\n\n\n\nArab Spring: After a slow start, the Obama administration eventually came around to calling for Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to step down, joining the NATO intervention in Libya, and supporting stricter sanctions against Syria. The president has been less outspoken about other Persian Gulf allies, including Bahrain, which hosts a key U.S. naval base. Obama has urged Egypt and Tunisia to \"set a strong example through free and fair elections, a vibrant civil society, accountable and effective democratic institutions, and responsible regional leadership.\" \n\n\n\n\nOther issues: Although he once described himself as a George H.W. Bush-school realist, in the past year Obama has learned to embrace humanitarian intervention, both in Libya and in central Africa, where military advisors have been sent to aid in the fight against the long-running insurgency by the Lord's Resistance Army. There's speculation that Nigeria may be next. It's a measure of how much things have changed in the last four years that Republicans are now attacking the Democratic president for trying to spread democracy and human rights at the barrel of a gun. \n\n\n\n\nAs the European economic crisis has worsened, Obama has been speaking out more in support of strong measures to protect the common currency. \"Ultimately what they are going to need is a firewall that sends a clear signal we stand behind the European project and we stand behind the euro,\" he said during his recent trip to Australia. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\fArticle 6.\n\n\nProject Syndicate\n\n\nAmerica in the Asian Century\n\n\nDominique Moisi\n\n\n\n\n\n2011-11-15 – At “ground zero” in lower Manhattan, two empty spaces will be filled by water cascades, memorializing in a serene and respectful way the victims of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Next to them, a powerful tower, designed by the architect Daniel Libeskind and nearly completed, rises vigorously into the sky, a symbol of the triumph of life over the forces of death. One word comes to mind to characterize the impression made by this place, the site of an unprecedented crime: resilience.\n\n\nIn a building that houses what will one day be a memorial museum, one can buy a DVD entitled “9/12: From Chaos to Community.” Ground Zero is the architectural and human proof that, despite America’s current economic woes, it would be premature, if not dangerous, to write the country off as a declining power. America has the moral and intellectual resources that it needs in order to rebound.\n\n\nBut what is necessary is not sufficient. In order to reinvent itself, if not to manage its relative international decline, America must proceed toward a rebalancing of its domestic and international priorities. In the immediate aftermath of World War I, a triumphant America withdrew from global responsibility, with tragic consequences for the balance of power in a Europe that was left to face its inner demons alone.\n\n\nIn the aftermath of World War II, by contrast, the US managed successfully to contain Soviet ambitions. Today, unlike in 1945, Americans do not confront an imminent threat. Russia may speak loudly (using its permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council as a megaphone), but it is a greatly reduced rump of the Soviet Union. Likewise, while the nationalism of America’s principal rival, China, has become more assertive lately, the communist regime’s clear priority – indeed, the key to its stability – is domestic economic growth.\n\n\nIndeed, the only obvious danger that the US faces stems from weapons of mass destruction, which could proliferate or be used by terrorist groups. But confronting this threat does not require a massive military budget or huge deployments of US troops all over the world. America has a much-needed opportunity to refocus on itself – to recover its inner strength without withdrawing from the world. As Richard Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, puts it, America must enter a period of “restoration” of its fundamentals.\n\n\nAmerican foreign policy starts at home, and that means reining in budget deficits over the long term, reviving economic growth and job creation in the short term, and addressing the country’s deteriorating infrastructure. Indeed, America’s “aged modernity” has become a drag on its competitiveness, as well as an insult to its international image and a risk to the safety of its citizens.\n\n\nMoreover, imperial fatigue has set in. Recent US history has been characterized by cycles of enthusiasm about foreign engagement. In the mid-1970’s, following the war in Vietnam, America, guided by President Jimmy Carter’s moralizing impulse, opted for “regionalization” of its engagements. But, given that the Soviet threat still existed, this effort came too early (and probably was carried out in the wrong manner).\n\n\nToday, by contrast, the starting point for a reassessment of American priorities is more economic than ethical. But the reasoning is the same, for it is based on the conviction that more America in the world today implies less costly and confused interventionism tomorrow. That means that US foreign policy itself – defined in recent years by too much attention to the Middle East, and too little to Asia – must embrace a shift in priorities.\n\n\nOf course, in the midst of today’s ongoing Arab revolutions, America cannot simply ignore the Middle East. Nor must the US give up hope on the Israel-Palestine front, or on its efforts to contain Iran’s nuclear ambitions. But it is in Asia that history is unfolding – and where the US must define its long-term global strategy.\n\n\nMust the US, as Henry Kissinger suggests in his latest book On China, consider the prospect of a “Pacific Community” that, unlike the Cold War-era Atlantic Community, is not based on common culture and values in the face of a direct threat, but on common interests in an “age of rebalancing of world order”?\n\n\nAmerica’s resilience may contrast with Europe’s multiple weaknesses. But resilience will not be enough. The US must get back into shape to face tomorrow’s challenges, and that means restoring economic growth, reducing deficits, and improving infrastructure. Paradoxically, only a more confident America can accept a reduced global status, because reconciling oneself to change is always easier once one has taken the steps needed to adjust to it.

The show’s creators, including veteran hitmakers Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk, assembled a large cast of transgender performers, and they’re P-H-E-N-O-M-E-N-A-L. Standouts include Mj Rodriguez as a politically conscious, HIV-positive house mother, and Indya Moore as Angel, a willowy femme whose married boyfriend works for Donald Trump. Truly, the \\u003Ci\\u003Eentire\\u003C/i\\u003E cast shines—from the get-go, we’re deeply invested in their victories and struggles. The costumes and sets are perfection, while the alternately intimate and epic storylines shift from entertaining spectacle to gut-wrenching drama without missing a beat.

The show’s creators, including veteran hitmakers Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk, assembled a large cast of transgender performers, and they’re P-H-E-N-O-M-E-N-A-L. Standouts include Mj Rodriguez as a politically conscious, HIV-positive house mother, and Indya Moore as Angel, a willowy femme whose married boyfriend works for Donald Trump. Truly, the \\u003Ci\\u003Eentire\\u003C/i\\u003E cast shines—from the get-go, we’re deeply invested in their victories and struggles. The costumes and sets are perfection, while the alternately intimate and epic storylines shift from entertaining spectacle to gut-wrenching drama without missing a beat. Above all, \\u003Ci\\u003EPose\\u003C/i\\u003E tackles dark realities like AIDS, transphobia, and bigotry, but somehow manages to sparkle with light.

But he added that \"some of the  key considerations are flipped.\"  In the Arizona case, conserva- tives insisted that respect for state  sovereignty required letting  states play a leading role in con- trolling immigration within their  borders. But Mr. Sessions, a long- time conservative himself, disa- vowed that position in his speech  on Wednesday. \"Immigration law  is the province of the federal gov- ernment,\" he said.  Justice Antonin Scalia, the con- servative jurist who died in 2016,  took a different view of the Ari- zona case. In an impassioned par- tial dissent, he wrote that \"it is  easy to lose sight of the states' tra- ditional role in regulating immi- gration — and to overlook their  sovereign prerogative to do so.\"  There is no doubt that the Cali- fornia lawsuit is at odds with some  of the Trump administration's  usual positions. \"It's a fascinating  suit on a number of levels,\" Profes- sor Vladeck said, \"not the least of  aznalosous contexts,  Cristina nearigoes, a law pro- at 'Yale said she detected  political parallels between the two  suits.  \"Both administrations claim  that the state laws they challenge  impermissibly interfere with the  executive branch's ability to en- force the immigration laws,\" she  said. \"But both lawsuits are also  clearly designed to take on visible  and politically powerful local offi- cials whose vision of immigration  policy conflicts with the presi- dent's and his supporters'.\"  In a news conference on  Wednesday, Xavier Becerra, the  California attorney general, said  he was ready for the fight. The  state's laws, he said, were \"fully  constitutional and provide for the  safety and welfare of all our peo- ple.\"  \"California is in the business of  public safety,\" he said. \"We are not  in the business of deportations?'  The Justice Department chal- lenged parts of three of Califor- nia's so-called sanctuary laws.  One restricts employers from co- operating with immigration offi- cials. A second generally prohibits  state officials from telling federal  ones when undocumented immi- grants are to be released from  NOAH BERGER/AGENGE FRANGE.PRESSE — GETTY IMAGES  Protesting a speech delivered by Attorney General Jeff Sessions in Sacramento on Wednesday.  The state may not  pursue policies that  undermine federal  law,' a justice wrote.  the commandeering issue was a  substantial one. \"To the ?xtenttlie-,_  Trump administration s claims  against California would produce  an outcome that would effectively  force states and localities to par- ticipate m immigration enforce- ment; she said,'. there couldhe an  unconstitutional commandeer- ing:\"  Professor Spiro said that Cali- fornia may have the upper hand in  the suit's early stages, as the is- sues in it are novel, leaving judges  with substantial discretion.  The Trump administration has  not fared well in federal courts in  California in other cases concern- ing immigration, including ones  challenging President Trump's ef- forts to restrict travel from pre- dominantly Muslim countries and  to rescind a program protecting  some 700,000 young unauthorized  immigrants from deportation.  But the ultimate fate of the suit  will probably rest with the Su- preme Court. In 2012, with what  may have been unwarranted opti- mism Justice Kennedy said he  hoped that conflicts over immi- gration policy would be worked  out through reasoned discussion.  \"The national government has  significant power to regulate im- migration,\" he wrote. \"The sound  exercise of national power over  immigration depends on the na- tion's meeting its responsibility to  base its laws on a political will in- formed by searching, thoughtful,  rational civic discourse?'  state custody. A third requires  state officials to inspect some fa- cilities that house people detained  on behalf of the federal govern- ment.  Jennifer Chacon, a law profes- sor at the University of California,  Irvine, said the state laws had  been carefully written to avoid di- rect conflicts with federal immi- gration laws. \"I think it is clear  that California deliberately tried  to draft laws that involved core ex- ercises of state police power in a  way that did not run afoul of fed- eral law,\" she said.  Each state law presents differ- ent issues, and courts may give  varying answers depending on  how directly the state laws con- flict with federal ones. More gen- erally, though, courts will take ac- count of the Supreme Court's deci- sion in the Arizona case, which  called for collaboration rather  than conflict.  \"Consultation between federal  and state officials is an important  feature of the immigration sys- tem?' Justice Kennedy wrote in  the court's decision in the Arizona  case.  Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat,  has said that consultation is fine  but that federal officials should  not use California's resources to  pursue undocumented Californi- ans. The federal government, he  added, may do so on its own.  \"They are free to use their own  considerable resources to enforce  federal immigration law in Cali- fornia,\" he said in October in sign- ing one of the challenged laws.  The Supreme Court has said  that the federal government may  not commandeer state resources  to achieve federal objectives. In  his speech on Wednesday, Mr. Ses- sions denied that anything like  that was afoot.  \"Contrary to what you might  hear from the lawless open bor- ders radicals,\" he said, \"we are not  asking California, Oakland or any- one else to enforce immigration  laws.\"  \"We are simply asking Califor- nia and other sanctuary jurisdic- tions to stop actively obstructing  federal law enforcement,\" he add- ed.  But Professor Rodriguez said  Investigating Sexual Misconduct Accusations, Arizona State Suspends a Physicist  By KENNETH CHANG  Arizona State University has  suspended Lawrence M. Krauss,  a prominent theoretical physicist,  while the university investigates  accusations of sexual misconduct  over a decade.  \"In an effort to avoid further  disruption to the normal course of  business as the university contin- ues to gather facts about the alle- gations, Krauss has been placed  on paid leave and is prohibited  from being on campus for the du- ration of the review,\" the univer- sity said in a statement released  on Thesday.  Last month, BuzzFeed reported  that several women have accused  Dr. Krauss of inappropriate be- havior including groping women  and making sexist jokes.  The university said it would not  Order home delivery today.  release any additional details until  its investigation is complete.  Dr. Krauss, a professor in the  university's School of Earth and  Space Exploration, is director of  Arizona State's Origins Project, a  multidisciplinary research effort  to tackle questions about life, the  universe and complex social prob- lems. He gained prominence for  his book, \"The Physics of Star  Trek\" in 1995. He later became one  of the leaders of the so-called  \"skeptics\" movement that es- pouses science over religion. He  has also written essays and Op-Ed  articles that were published in  The Times.  Michael Crow, president of Ari- zona State, told The State Press,  an independent student news or- ganization, that the university had  received no complaints of har- assment against Dr. Krauss. The  university started the investiga- tion after being contacted by Buz- zFeed.  Dr. Krauss moved to Arizona  State from Case Western Reserve  University in Ohio in 2008.  Lawrence M.

But Mr. Sessions, a long-\ntime conservative himself, disa-\nvowed that position in his speech \non Wednesday. \"Immigration law \nis the province of the federal gov-\nernment,\" he said. \nJustice Antonin Scalia, the con-\nservative jurist who died in 2016, \ntook a different view of the Ari-\nzona case. In an impassioned par-\ntial dissent, he wrote that \"it is \neasy to lose sight of the states' tra-\nditional role in regulating immi-\ngration — and to overlook their \nsovereign prerogative to do so.\" \nThere is no doubt that the Cali-\nfornia lawsuit is at odds with some \nof the Trump administration's \nusual positions. \"It's a fascinating \nsuit on a number of levels,\" Profes-\nsor Vladeck said, \"not the least of \naznalosous contexts, \nCristina nearigoes, a law pro-\nat 'Yale said she detected \npolitical parallels between the two \nsuits. \n\"Both administrations claim \nthat the state laws they challenge \nimpermissibly interfere with the \nexecutive branch's ability to en-\nforce the immigration laws,\" she \nsaid. \"But both lawsuits are also \nclearly designed to take on visible \nand politically powerful local offi-\ncials whose vision of immigration \npolicy conflicts with the presi-\ndent's and his supporters'.\" \nIn a news conference on \nWednesday, Xavier Becerra, the \nCalifornia attorney general, said \nhe was ready for the fight. The \nstate's laws, he said, were \"fully \nconstitutional and provide for the \nsafety and welfare of all our peo-\nple.\" \n\"California is in the business of \npublic safety,\" he said. \"We are not \nin the business of deportations?' \nThe Justice Department chal-\nlenged parts of three of Califor-\nnia's so-called sanctuary laws. \nOne restricts employers from co-\noperating with immigration offi-\ncials.

In 2012, with what \nmay have been unwarranted opti-\nmism Justice Kennedy said he \nhoped that conflicts over immi-\ngration policy would be worked \nout through reasoned discussion. \n\"The national government has \nsignificant power to regulate im-\nmigration,\" he wrote. \"The sound \nexercise of national power over \nimmigration depends on the na-\ntion's meeting its responsibility to \nbase its laws on a political will in-\nformed by searching, thoughtful, \nrational civic discourse?' \nstate custody. A third requires \nstate officials to inspect some fa-\ncilities that house people detained \non behalf of the federal govern-\nment. \nJennifer Chacon, a law profes-\nsor at the University of California, \nIrvine, said the state laws had \nbeen carefully written to avoid di-\nrect conflicts with federal immi-\ngration laws. \"I think it is clear \nthat California deliberately tried \nto draft laws that involved core ex-\nercises of state police power in a \nway that did not run afoul of fed-\neral law,\" she said. \nEach state law presents differ-\nent issues, and courts may give \nvarying answers depending on \nhow directly the state laws con-\nflict with federal ones. More gen-\nerally, though, courts will take ac-\ncount of the Supreme Court's deci-\nsion in the Arizona case, which \ncalled for collaboration rather \nthan conflict. \n\"Consultation between federal \nand state officials is an important \nfeature of the immigration sys-\ntem?' Justice Kennedy wrote in \nthe court's decision in the Arizona \ncase. \nGov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, \nhas said that consultation is fine \nbut that federal officials should \nnot use California's resources to \npursue undocumented Californi-\nans. The federal government, he \nadded, may do so on its own. \n\"They are free to use their own \nconsiderable resources to enforce \nfederal immigration law in Cali-\nfornia,\" he said in October in sign-\ning one of the challenged laws. \nThe Supreme Court has said \nthat the federal government may \nnot commandeer state resources \nto achieve federal objectives. In \nhis speech on Wednesday, Mr. Ses-\nsions denied that anything like \nthat was afoot. \n\"Contrary to what you might \nhear from the lawless open bor-\nders radicals,\" he said, \"we are not \nasking California, Oakland or any-\none else to enforce immigration \nlaws.\" \n\"We are simply asking Califor-\nnia and other sanctuary jurisdic-\ntions to stop actively obstructing \nfederal law enforcement,\" he add-\ned. \nBut Professor Rodriguez said \nInvestigating Sexual Misconduct Accusations, Arizona State Suspends a Physicist \nBy KENNETH CHANG \nArizona State University has \nsuspended Lawrence M.

Such accusations, then, without presenting any credible evidence, are \nslanderous. \nAlso, there would be no political or diplomatic capital gained by either of the \"accused\"... there would be little \nfor the Russian government to gain - it would be a huge diplomatic embarrassment for the Russian government \nto be found guilty of essentially assassinating a head of state. Kaczynski was one of the strongest allies of the \nU.S. among European leaders, and even Russia with its assertive diplomatic policies would not risk a complete \nbreakdown with the U.S. by killing a close ally. International condemnation would also follow, and the \nPresident - perhaps even the Prime Minister - would have to resign and wave good-bye to any political career in \nthe foreseeable future. Yes, \"even in Russia.\" \nSimilarly, for the Prime Minister's party, if he were actually complicit in the crash, that would mean he - or his \nallies - committed a coup d'etat. Also, there will be early presidential elections in June, which might actually go \nin favor of the President's party because of a sympathy vote. The \"acting\" Presidency is in the hands of his party \nfor only two months... so, again, the Prime Minister and his allies have nothing to gain and potentially \neverything to lose in the June vote. \nConspiracy-monging cheapens a national tragedy \nPolitical profit or loss questions aside, however, the conspiracy-monging seems to be taken as a way to discover \nwho's responsible for the tragedy and thus somehow bring them justice. However, it is not a healthy way to deal \nwith the tragedy. It is not conducive to national or personal healing. Furthermore, it disgraces and taints the \nmemory of those who died. \nIt only cheapens the tragedy and, sadly, may foreshadow what's to come in the coming presidential campaign - \nthe tragedy may be used by certain groups or individuals to propagate their own agenda and assume the \npresidency. \nIt is not so different than what has been going on in the U.S., with the \"birthers\" claiming Barack Obama is not \nlegally the President because he is not actually a citizen, or even natural-born citizen. Not as morbid, of course, \nbut still, in my honest opinion, ridiculous. \nBaseless, nonsensical conspiracies simply destroys the abiltiy of the nation and people of Poland to move on \nand honor the memory of those lost, and cheapens the tragedy that has been felt by Poles as far away as Chicago \nas well, and commented on with deep sorrow and respect by U.S. politicians from Mayor Daley to President \nObama himself \nJeffrey Epstein \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 032049 \n\n\n\nNA\n\nFrom: \n\nTo: \n\nCC: NA\n\nSubject: \n\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 032053\n\nFrom: \nSent: \nTo: \nSubject: \n4/7/2017 12:28:56 PM \nRe: \ni asked him about trump and russians he said maybe some truth there,If you want to meet him just give me the wordjf \nwhy dont you suggest to him that the real money making book is getting to the truth of the claims. unvierstiy of \nvirgina. no penalty for fals accusations. . hockey team no penalty for accusations. . trump 13 yeara old rape \naccusation no penaltiy etc. mine is ripe with same \nOn Fri, Apr 7, 2017 at 8:11 AM, wrote: \nDo you want me to arrange it? be careful j \nim happy to meet him \nOn Fri, Apr 7, 2017 at 7:39 AM, Jonathan Farkas wrote: \nWent to opening of war paint last night was sitting next to john Connolly at after party he is on to his next book about \nEf Hutton murders apparently was going to put me in your book because I was in your visitors list but somers and \nMargo nederlander asked him not to which pisses me off I have never been in a big book before and I think it would \nhave been great and they never even asked me I told him about how you called Apple best jonathan \nSent from my iPhone \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 032053 \n\n\n\nNA\n\nFrom: \n\nTo: \n\nCC: NA\n\nSubject: \n\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 032062\n\nFrom: \nSent: \nTo: \nSubject: \nAttachments: \nMartin G.

Strive Masiyiwa (right) with Bill Clinton and his daughter NEW ZIMBABWE 19-08-2014 SPEAKING at a microfinance symposium in Turin, Italy, recently, Econet Wireless founder Strive Masiyiwa recalled the ruling by the judge who gave him a licence in 1998 saying that “70 percent of people in the country had never heard a telephone ring” The licence was granted after a costly five-year legal battle against the government. According to the UK-based Guardian newspaper Masiyiwa told the Turin gathering that “today, 75 percent of people [in Zimbabwe] have a cell phone; and I want 75 percent of the people in Africa to have a bank account … on a mobile phone.” Not only that, Econet Wireless has since grown into a diversified technology and financial services group with operations in 17 countries including Botswana, Lesotho, Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa and New Zealand. Another problem, and opportunity, arose when the government ditched the Zimbabwe dollar in 2009 for more stable foreign currencies. The transacting public, having struggled with huge amounts of worthless cash in the hyperinflation years, welcomed the decision. But with the country’s productive and export sectors all but collapsed, there just wasn’t enough of the foreign currencies in circulation. “If you wanted to buy a packet of sweets for your child, you couldn’t get change,” said Masiyiwa. Econet intervened with a mobile payments system which has set Zimbabwe on course to become Africa’s first cashless economy. “Today 43 percent of the GDP moves through Econet Wireless,” said the telecoms mogul. Explained Econet’s chief executive, Douglas Mboweni , recently said: “We do not expect anyone to still be using paper money in a year’s time. It will be just like Europe or America, where you no longer see people carrying bundles of cash.” Masiyiwa told the Guardian that his next challenge is to create a product that allows people who are informally employed, such as smallholder farmers and casual workers, to access credit. “In Africa 70 percent of people are informally employed,” he says. “The big frontier for us is to create platforms where those people can access credit.” There is little risk that they will get into unmanageable debt because the banks won’t extend excessive credit, calling the system “self-regulating”. “We’re trying to build up a savings culture where people are encouraged to save, even if they only have a dollar – for children’s school fees, for transport, for the doctor. A savings and credit infrastructure builds resilience.” However, in order to reach the unbanked, financial institutions – and telecommunications companies – must design services that are practical, simple and affordable. “I’ve got a customer who has a dollar in his pocket and has got to decide to have some lunch, call his cousin or go to the doctor,” he said. “We have to develop services with sensitivity to the fact that in Africa our customers don’t have the same disposable income as in New Zealand, for example.” It would however, be a mistake to assume the poorest behave differently to other customers. “Their behaviour and aspirations are no different from those who have higher incomes,” cautioned Masiyiwa. “They want to use Facebook. They want to use WhatsApp. We have to find ways for them to access those things with their very low income.” The UK Guardian 19-08-2014 - Will Zimbabwe be Africa’s first cashless society? Telecommunications company, and now mobile banking service, Econet Wireless predicts that in less than 12 months notes and coins will be long-gone from this southern African country. “We do not expect anyone to still be using paper money in a year’s time,” the company’s CEO Douglas Mboweni recently said. “It will be just like Europe or America, where you no longer see people carrying bundles of cash.” The collapse of Zimbabwe’s economy in 2002 paved the way for Econet Wireless’s mobile payment system. “Hyperinflation had destroyed people’s confidence in financial institutions,” said the Zimbabwe company’s founder, Strive Masiyiwa, at the Mastercard Foundation Symposium on Financial Inclusion in July. “The lowest denomination circulating was $1,” Masiyiwa said. “If you want to buy a packet of sweets for your child, you can’t get change.” The company set up a mobile payment system that handles small amounts and allows people to save as little as $1. “Today 43% of the GDP moves through Econet Wireless,” he concludes. Masiyiwa was born in Zimbabawe (then Rhodesia) in 1961. He and his parents fled the country in the turmoil after prime minister Ian Smith declared independence in 1965, settling in Zambia. His parents, who ran their own business, could afford to send Masiyiwa to school in Scotland when he was 12. After school he studied electronic engineering at the University of Wales and worked briefly for a computer company in Cambridge before returning to Zimbabwe in the early 1980s. Econet Wireless was established in 1998, but not before a fight. Masiyiwa waged a five-year legal battle with the government for a licence to deliver telephone services. The company now operates in 17 countries including Botswana, Lesotho, Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa and New Zealand. In 2000, while the UN filed a civil suit against Mugabe, Masiyiwa moved his family and company headquarters to South Africa. Econet Wireless first developed mobile payments to help NGOs transfer money to refugees after the war in Burundi ended in 2005. “Donor agencies were trying to find ways to make cash disbursements to refugees,” says Masiyiwa. “So we built the payment system initially not as a business but as a way to help humanitarians get money to people in rural areas who were trying to re-establish their lives.” That model was extended and now mobile money transfers are central to Econet Wireless’s business. Like M-Pesa before it, the company blurs the lines between telecomms and banking. Masiyiwa is passionate about this latter part of his business. He believes that extending saving and credit services to the poorest people gives them “extraordinary dignity and a sense that they are in control of their own lives”. His next challenge is to create a product that allows people who are informally employed, such as smallholder farmers and casual workers, to access credit. “In Africa 70% of people are informally employed,” he says. “The big frontier for us is to create platforms where those people can access credit.” He says there’s no risk that they will get into unmanageable debt because the banks won’t extend excessive credit, calling the system “self-regulating”. But Masiyiwa says that offering people the ability to save is even more important than credit. “We’re trying to build up a savings culture where people are encouraged to save, even if they only have a dollar – for children’s school fees, for transport, for the doctor. A savings and credit infrastructure builds resilience.” In his speech to microfinance experts at the symposium in Turin, Masiyiwa recounted a story about the judge in Zimbabwe who granted Econet Wireless’s licence in 1998, saying that 70% of people in the country had never heard a telephone ring. “Today, 75% of people [in Zimbabwe] have a cell phone,” he said “And I want 75% of the people in Africa to have a bank account … on a mobile phone.” And Masiyiwa has even found a solution to the energy problem that could prevent him from realising his dream. “We have developed solar charging stations where people can go into a kiosk and plug in their phone for free. Because our money is not made from someone charging the phone. It’s made from someone using the phone.” By way of lessons learnt, Masiyiwa says that in order to reach the unbanked, financial institutions – and telecommunications companies – must design services that are practical, simple and affordable. “I’ve got a customer who has a dollar in his pocket and has got to decide to have some lunch, call his cousin or go to the doctor. We have to develop services with sensitivity to the fact that in Africa our customers don’t have the same disposable income as in New Zealand, for example.” But the billionaire businessman cautions that it’s a mistake assume the poorest behave differently to other customers. “Their behaviour and aspirations are no different from those who have higher incomes,” he says. “They want to use Facebook. They want to use WhatsApp. We have to find ways for them to access those things with their very low income.”\n\nStrive Masiyiwa’s next challenge\nRespected by world leaders ...

His parents, who ran\ntheir own business, could afford to send Masiyiwa to school in Scotland when he was 12.\nAfter school he studied electronic engineering at the University of Wales and worked briefly\nfor a computer company in Cambridge before returning to Zimbabwe in the early 1980s.\nEconet Wireless was established in 1998, but not before a fight. Masiyiwa waged a five-year\nlegal battle with the government for a licence to deliver telephone services. The company\nnow operates in 17 countries including Botswana, Lesotho, Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa and\nNew Zealand. In 2000, while the UN filed a civil suit against Mugabe, Masiyiwa moved his\nfamily and company headquarters to South Africa. Econet Wireless first developed mobile\npayments to help NGOs transfer money to refugees after the war in Burundi ended in 2005.\n“Donor agencies were trying to find ways to make cash disbursements to refugees,” says\nMasiyiwa. “So we built the payment system initially not as a business but as a way to help\nhumanitarians get money to people in rural areas who were trying to re-establish their lives.”\nThat model was extended and now mobile money transfers are central to Econet Wireless’s\nbusiness. Like M-Pesa before it, the company blurs the lines between telecomms and\nbanking. Masiyiwa is passionate about this latter part of his business. He believes that\nextending saving and credit services to the poorest people gives them “extraordinary dignity\nand a sense that they are in control of their own lives”. His next challenge is to create a\nproduct that allows people who are informally employed, such as smallholder farmers and\ncasual workers, to access credit. “In Africa 70% of people are informally employed,” he says.\n“The big frontier for us is to create platforms where those people can access credit.” He says\nthere’s no risk that they will get into unmanageable debt because the banks won’t extend\nexcessive credit, calling the system “self-regulating”.\nBut Masiyiwa says that offering people the ability to save is even more important than credit.\n“We’re trying to build up a savings culture where people are encouraged to save, even if\nthey only have a dollar – for children’s school fees, for transport, for the doctor. A savings\nand credit infrastructure builds resilience.” In his speech to microfinance experts at the\nsymposium in Turin, Masiyiwa recounted a story about the judge in Zimbabwe who granted\nEconet Wireless’s licence in 1998, saying that 70% of people in the country had never heard\na telephone ring. “Today, 75% of people [in Zimbabwe] have a cell phone,” he said “And I\nwant 75% of the people in Africa to have a bank account … on a mobile phone.”\nAnd Masiyiwa has even found a solution to the energy problem that could prevent him from\nrealising his dream. “We have developed solar charging stations where people can go into a\nkiosk and plug in their phone for free. Because our money is not made from someone\ncharging the phone. It’s made from someone using the phone.” By way of lessons learnt,\nMasiyiwa says that in order to reach the unbanked, financial institutions – and\ntelecommunications companies – must design services that are practical, simple and\naffordable. “I’ve got a customer who has a dollar in his pocket and has got to decide to have\nsome lunch, call his cousin or go to the doctor. We have to develop services with sensitivity\nto the fact that in Africa our customers don’t have the same disposable income as in New\nZealand, for example.”\nBut the billionaire businessman cautions that it’s a mistake assume the poorest behave\ndifferently to other customers. “Their behaviour and aspirations are no different from those\nwho have higher incomes,” he says. “They want to use Facebook. They want to use\nWhatsApp. We have to find ways for them to access those things with their very low\nincome.”\n\n\n\nNA\n\nFrom: NA\n\nTo: NA\n\nCC: NA\n\nSubject: NA\n\n                     26 June, 2011   Article 1.

NYT   Building Boom in Gaza’s Ruins Belies Misery That Remains   Ethan Bronner      June 25, 2011 -- GAZA — Two luxury hotels are opening in Gaza this month. Thousands of new cars are plying the roads. A second shopping mall — with escalators imported from Israel — will open next month. Hundreds of homes and two dozen schools are about to go up. A Hamas-run farm where Jewish settlements once stood is producing enough fruit that Israeli imports are tapering off.    As pro-Palestinian activists prepare to set sail aboard a flotilla aimed at maintaining an international spotlight on Gaza and pressure on Israel, this isolated Palestinian coastal enclave is experiencing its first real period of economic growth since the siege they are protesting began in 2007.    “Things are better than a year ago,” said Jamal El-Khoudary, chairman of the board of the Islamic University, who has led Gaza’s Popular Committee Against the Siege. “The siege on goods is now 60 to 70 percent over.”    Ala al-Rafati, the economy minister for Hamas, the militant group that governs Gaza, said in an interview that nearly 1,000 factories are operating here, and he estimated unemployment at no more than 25 percent after a sharp drop in jobless levels in the first quarter of this year. “Yesterday alone, the Gaza municipality launched 12 projects for paving roads, digging wells and making gardens,” he said.    So is that the news from Gaza in mid-2011? Yes, but so is this: Thousands of homes that were destroyed in the Israeli antirocket invasion two and a half years ago have not been rebuilt. Hospitals have canceled elective surgery for lack of supplies. Electricity remains maddeningly irregular. The much-publicized opening of the Egyptian border has fizzled, so people remain trapped here. The number of residents living on less than $1.60 a day has tripled in four years. Three-quarters of the population rely on food aid.    Areas with as contested a history as this one can choose among anniversaries to commemorate. It has been four years since Hamas took over, prompting Israel and Egypt to impose a blockade on people and most goods. It is a year since a Turkish flotilla challenged the siege and Israeli commandos killed nine activists aboard the ships, leading to international outrage and an easing of conditions. And it is five years since an Israeli soldier, Staff Sgt. Gilad Shalit, was abducted and held in captivity without even visits from the Red Cross.    In assessing the condition of the 1.6 million people who live in Gaza, there are issues of where to draw the baseline and — often — what motivates the discussion. It has never been among the world’s poorest places. There is near universal literacy and relatively low infant mortality, and health conditions remain better than across much of the developing world.    “We have 100 percent vaccination; no polio, measles, diphtheria or AIDS,” said Mahmoud Daher, a World Health Organization official here. “We’ve never had a cholera outbreak.”    The Israeli government and its defenders use such data to portray Gaza as doing just fine and Israeli policy as humane and appropriate: no flotillas need set sail.    Israel’s critics say the fact that the conditions in Gaza do not rival the problems in sub-Saharan Africa only makes the political and human rights crisis here all the more tragic — and solvable. Israel, they note, still controls access to sea, air and most land routes, and its security policies have consciously strangled development opportunities for an educated and potentially high-achieving population that is trapped with no horizon. Pressure needs to be maintained to end the siege entirely, they say, and talk of improvement is counterproductive.    The recent changes stem from a combination of Israeli policy shifts and the chaos in Egypt. The new Egyptian border policy has made little difference, but Egypt’s revolution and its reduced policing in the Sinai have had a profound effect.    For the past year, Israel has allowed most everything into Gaza but cement, steel and other construction material — other than for internationally supervised projects — because they are worried that such supplies can be used by Hamas for bunkers and bombs. A number of international projects are proceeding, but there is an urgent need for housing, street paving, schools, factories and public works projects, all under Hamas or the private sector, and Israel’s policy bans access to the goods to move those forward.    So in recent months, tunnels under the southern border that were used to bring in consumer goods have become almost fully devoted to smuggling in building materials.    Sacks of cement and piles of gravel, Turkish in origin and bought legally in Egypt, are smuggled through the hundreds of tunnels in double shifts, day and night, totaling some 3,000 tons a day. Since the overthrow of President Hosni Mubarak, the Egyptian security authorities no longer stop the smugglers. Streets are being paved and buildings constructed.    “Mubarak was crushing us before,” said Mahmoud Mohammad, a subcontractor whose 10-man crew in Gaza City was unloading steel bars that were carried through the tunnels and were destined for a new restaurant. “Last year we were sitting at home. The contractor I work for has three major projects going.”    Nearby, Amer Selmi was supervising the building of a three-story, $2 million wedding hall. Most of his materials come from the tunnels.    Karim Gharbawi is an architect and building designer with 10 projects under way, all of them eight- and nine-story residential properties. He said there were some 130 engineering and design firms in Gaza. Two years ago, none were working. Today, he said, all of them are.    Another result of the regional changes is the many new cars here. Israel allows in 20 a week, but that does not meet the need. Hundreds of BMWs, pickup trucks and other vehicles have arrived in recent months from Libya, driven through Egypt and sold via the unmonitored tunnels. Dozens of white Kia Sportage models, ubiquitous on the street, are widely thought to have come from the same dealership in Benghazi, Libya, that was looted after the uprising there began.    Hamas’s control of Gaza appears firmer than ever, and the looser tunnel patrols in Egypt mean greater access to weapons as well. But opinion surveys show that its more secular rival, Fatah, is more popular. That may explain why an attempt at political unity with Fatah is moving slowly: the Hamas leaders here are likely to lose their jobs. The hospital supply crisis is a direct result of tensions with Fatah in the West Bank, which has kept the supplies from being shipped here.    Efforts by fringe Islamist groups to challenge Hamas have had little effect. And it has been a year since the government unsuccessfully sought to impose tighter religious restrictions by banning women from smoking water pipes in public. On a recent afternoon in the new Carino’s restaurant — with billiards, enormous flat-screen televisions, buttery-soft chairs — women without head coverings were smoking freely.    But such places and people represent a wafer-thin slice of Gazan society, and focusing on them distorts the broader and grimmer picture.    Samah Saleh is a 21-year-old medical student who lives in the Jabaliya refugee camp. Her father, an electrician, is adding a second story to their house now that material is available from the tunnels. Ms. Saleh will get her own room for the first time in her life, but she views her good fortune in context.    “For the vast majority in Gaza, things are not improving,” she said. “Most people in Gaza remain forgotten.”           \fArticle 2.   Herald Tribune   Buying Into Palestinian Statehood   Yossi Alpher, Colette Avital, Shlomo Gazit, and Mark Heller      June 24, 2011— Instead of wasting time and energy trying to revive a moribund Israeli-Palestinian peace process, the United States and European Union should take another look at the Palestinian initiative to seek U.N. recognition in September. What is described in some quarters as a recipe for new strife and confrontation can actually be leveraged into a win-win situation for Israelis, Palestinians and the world.    The Palestinians under Mahmoud Abbas want the United Nations to grant them a sovereign state based on the 1967 boundaries with East Jerusalem as its capital. That’s all. It is not asking the U.N. to solve the refugee /right-of-return issue or to determine who owns the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. It is opting to convert an intractable conflict between a state and a liberation movement into a state-to-state conflict with manageable parameters.    Why not offer the Palestinians what they want, but add elements that could render the resolution acceptable to a majority of Israelis?    Israel wants acceptance as a Jewish state with its recognized capital in Jerusalem. It needs assurances regarding the nature and priorities of future negotiations, with the truly intractable issues postponed to a later phase. It needs solid security arrangements, understandings regarding Hamas rule in Gaza, and a viable incentive from an Arab world that has long offered to reward it for moving forward with the Palestinians.    Here are the components of a possible “win-win” U.N. resolution regarding Palestinian statehood:    • Reaffirm support for the resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict on the basis of two states for two peoples and the right of the Jewish and Palestinian peoples to self-determination, without prejudice to the rights of all citizens and minority groups. Recall, in this context, U.N. General Assembly resolution 181 of 1947 that called for the establishment of a Jewish state and an Arab state.    • Acknowledge institutional and security reform, economic development and state-building efforts — especially in the West Bank, under the leadership of President Abbas and Prime Minister Salam Fayyad, which have helped lay the foundations for Palestinian statehood — and endorse the position articulated by the World Bank and the United Nations that the Palestinian Authority is “well positioned for the establishment of a state at any point in the near future.”    • Accordingly, support the establishment of an independent and sovereign Palestinian state on the basis of the 1967 lines with its capital in East Jerusalem in parallel with Israel’s recognized capital in West Jerusalem, and with mutually agreed territorial swaps and modifications, subject to negotiation — a state that will live side by side with Israel in peace and security.    • Recognize that extending the authority of a Palestinian state to the Gaza Strip will depend on effective control there by a legitimate Palestinian government that exercises authority in the West Bank, is committed to the Quartet principles and the Arab Peace Initiative and respects the commitments of the Palestine Liberation Organization.    • Call for both states to engage in good faith negotiations on the basis of this and previous relevant resolutions and agreements in order to resolve all outstanding issues between them, beginning with the issues of borders, settlements, water and security arrangements. Specifically, security arrangements — including multi-layered international, regional and bilateral guarantees — should confront and neutralize threats and enable the phased withdrawal of Israeli forces from a demilitarized Palestinian state with an effective internal security force and without compromising Israeli security.    • Note the importance of the Arab Peace Initiative, endorsed by the Arab League in 2002, and call for regional states to assist in creating an atmosphere conducive to negotiation and agreement, including by intensifying efforts to advance coexistence and normalization of relations between Arab League members and Israel.    A creative and courageous approach to leveraging the Palestinian initiative will not end the conflict. But it could make it far more manageable.

Khouri      June 25, 2011 -- My pleasure at speaking this week in Ottawa at a gathering at the International Development Research Center of Canada was compounded by the very thoughtful questions and comments that members of the audience offered.   The audience raised new questions in my mind about what is likely or possibly may occur in the Arab region, as the current citizen revolt moves into its seventh month. The issues they raised revolved around the reality that there is no certain outcome to the developments in assorted Arab countries. While I and many other Arab citizens feel that the wave of democratic transformations will continue to wash across most of the region, sweeping away old and young autocrats and opening the door to new democracies, this is by no means certain.   Economic pressures, for one, could easily create such immense stresses on families that many Arabs who celebrated the Tunisian and Egyptian regime changes may welcome the return of strongmen who restrict citizens’ powers but provide more jobs. I doubt this will happen, but we can never rule it out. The demands of children’s stomachs crying out for food that many families cannot afford to buy are immensely powerful drivers of political behavior.   Another threat that some audience members raised was related to the potential break-up of some countries into smaller units that could be more easily controlled by regional or foreign powers. The first Arab revolt against the Ottomans around a century ago occurred simultaneously with the Sykes-Picot accord, by which France and Great Britain carved up the Arab east into smaller units that were put under the rule of locally chosen leaders whom the Europeans knew they could trust. It is possible that the current transformations might result in security vacuums that local parties or foreign powers could exploit to fragment some Arab states into smaller units that would then be more reliant on foreign support or protection.   Sudan has already split into northern and southern states, while Yemen, Iraq and possibly a few others are similarly susceptible to subdivision into smaller statelets. This raises difficult issues about the inviolability of the current Arab borders that the retreating Europeans created last century. I thought the secession of South Sudan was a perfectly acceptable development, if it reflected the will of the people of the south, and was not imposed on them. The operative principle in such possible developments is whether change reflects the consent of the governed and represents the will of the majority, while protecting the rights of minorities. If Yemenis decide to split again into two or even three states, and this reflects the free will of the Yemeni people, they should be allowed to do so without external interference.   There is nothing sacred or permanent about the borders of any country, especially Arab countries that were mostly created by the handiwork of European colonial officers. Countries evolve and sometimes change shape as a routine historical process. If some Arabs decide they are uncomfortable with their existing state boundaries and they wish to break away and form a separate country, that should always be an option. After all, the world mostly rejoiced when the former Soviet Union and its empire collapsed and some of its constituent republics fragmented into smaller units, notably Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia.   We should be prepared to deal with the specter of existing Arab countries that reconfigure their frontiers and populations while they are reconfiguring their political governance systems.   Another point that was raised in several different forms related to how the current Arab revolt would affect relations with major Western countries, especially since many Western powers actively supported the Arab autocrats who are now being challenged and, in some cases, removed from office. Would newly liberated Arab citizenries seek revenge against Western powers?   My impression is that this will depend on the new policies that these Western powers adopt, rather than on what they did in the past. Most Arabs are critical of Western powers because they unquestioningly back Israel or support Arab autocrats. Should those policies be moderated and replaced by more even-handed postures toward the Middle East, newly liberated Arab citizens would probably be too busy building their new countries to allow themselves to be distracted by lingering resentments from the past.   What is the single most important development that could trigger regime change in some countries now facing domestic challenges and unrest, one person asked? Three reasons come to mind: economic collapse could do so; or key figures in the military and security agencies could stop protecting the regime; or strategically placed commercial, tribal, sectarian and business leaders in society could decide that the current course was disastrous and, in consequence, could bring about the fall of the regime.       \fArticle 4.   Guardian   Why Israel is wrong about Iran   Meir Javedanfar       25 June 2011 -- Israel's former intelligence chief, Meir Dagan, has been subjected to a firestorm of criticism – from the Israeli government as well as sections of the media – since he stated that attacking Iran's nuclear installations would be \"a stupid idea\".   So strong has been the reaction that the prime minister's office even asked him to return his diplomatic passport. What seems to be bothering some Israelis, including Ari Shavit, the respected Haaretz journalist, is that Dagan has now \"made the Iranians think they can continue galloping to the bomb because they are not in any real danger\".  This claim, though, is a clear example of where some in Israel are getting it wrong with regard to Iran and what the Iranian leadership perceives as serious threats.  Israel has to realise that the Tehran regime is more petrified by what is happening to its economy and among its own population than by the possibility of a military attack from Israel. When it comes to using violence, this regime has had 32 years of experience. It can cope. However, the regime is so frightened of its own population that it breaks up silent demonstrations. It panicked when the shooting of Neda Agha Soltan was filmed and broadcast to the world. It even went as far as to temporarily ban books by Paulo Coelho – simply because his editor in Iran, Arash Hejazi, was seen trying to save Neda's life.   Dagan could be wrong in his assessment but, even if he is right, it does not mean that cessation of a military threat from Israel would induce the Iranian government to \"gallop ahead\" towards the bomb without any concern.   The biggest reason why Iran's supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, has agreed to talks during the last few years is not the fear of a military attack by Israel. The biggest reason is that he is worried about his country's economy, which is far more crucial to the regime's survival than the nuclear programme. The Islamic regime in Iran has not and will not live on its nuclear programme. It lives on its economy.  Khamenei is worried that if he doesn't negotiate, the west will find it easier to justify isolating his country. This, in turn, will make it easier to gain international approval for tough economic sanctions.  With so much legitimacy lost domestically after Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's controversial election in 2009, Khamenei has even more reason to worry about the impact that sanctions could have on the survival of his regime. This is the main reason why he is negotiating and will continue to do so. This is also why he will be careful, as he was before Dagan's statement, in the way he approaches his nuclear programme.  One also has to ask: which is the bigger reason why the international community is becoming more united against Iran's nuclear programme? Its distaste and concern for Khamanei's desire to have access to a bomb (which is becoming more apparent from clause 35 of the most recent IAEA report), or threats by Israel to attack Iran's nuclear installations? After recent revelations, such as the secret enrichment site near Qom, the former is more true.  To deal with such a regime and to confront its controversial nuclear programme, instead of constantly relying on military threats, Israel's leaders would be better advised to study Coelho's masterpiece, The Alchemist, and page 121 in particular:    \"When you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.\"   Israel is no longer alone in its belief that Iran wants to build a bomb. Judging by the support for sanctions, the UN and especially its security council members are more on the side of Israel than Iran. This includes countries such as South Korea that have adopted unilateral sanctions against Iran.  In its bid to stop Iran's nuclear programme Israel should help itself and the international community. The most potent way would be by improving relations with the Islamic world, especially the PLO and Turkey. Israel had good relations with them before. It can do so again.   Fortunately for Israel, and unfortunately for Khamenei, Israel even has the option to hurt the regime on its very own streets.   That option is the cessation of verbal military threats against Iran. Cessation of military threats from Israel will make it much harder for the regime to divert the public's attention away from its falling popularity and serious domestic problems. Silence from Israel will make Iran's leaders more worried, as it will rob Khamenei from an important tool which has helped him, and at a crucial time when the regime is hemorrhaging legitimacy and popularity at an unprecedented rate. The damage such an endeavour will cause is worth the inconvenience of Israeli politicians having to bite their tongues.   Cessation of verbal threats will also prevent significant future damage being caused to Israel's deterrence posture if, at the end of the day, it decides to not to attack Iran's nuclear installations.   Coelho once said:    \"Be careful. You can hurt with your words, but you can also hurt with your silence.\"   The words of a wise man.

The Financial Time   Global oil supplies are healthier than they seem    Ian Bremmer      June 24, 2011 -- Many of the world’s oil consuming nations, led by the US, shocked oil markets this week as the International Energy Agency agreed to release 60m barrels of oil from strategic reserves over the coming month. The move was intended to offset price pressures brought about by Libya’s supply cut and comes in response to Opecs recent inability to formally endorse new supply increases. The IEA action is also an example of growing concern over higher oil prices in Washington, where the White House is managing political fallout from high gasoline prices as next year’s presidential elections loom just over the horizon.   Yet, a year from now, we’re likely to look back on this moment and find that fears for supply have diminished. There are three reasons.   First, the most substantial fallout from the Arab world’s recent upheaval is behind us. Syria’s Bashar al-Assad continues to  fight for survival and Yemen continues to flirt with failed-state status, but the Gulf’s major oil-producing states are quite stable. So are other major producers. Even in Iran, with its leaders infighting, the green revolution has moved off the streets for now. While there are plenty of long-term structural challenges for many major economies ﻿– just ask China – for the moment there are no more Libyas left to explode. IEA action and the ongoing Saudi supply increases will neutralise what remains of the oil price’s political risk premium.   Second, big additional supply is coming, and it’s not all priced in. Offshore Brazil and Canadian oil sands are no longer new stories, but their collective impact has not yet been fully felt and is often undervalued. Iraq still draws undue scepticism but production there is showing serious promise. The country could add up to 300,000 barrels this year, with more contracts, more exploration and more drilling already in the works. Barring an unlikely and total implosion of the government, it is hard to see production slowing down this decade. The same is true for “tight oil” coming from unconventional sources. We are seeing this begin to play out in North American fields such as the Bakken in North Dakota. As technology and investment are dispersed over the coming year, oil supply should positively surprise.   Third, Saudi supply increases are not dependant on Opec. The country’s oil minister Ali Naimi left the cartel’s Vienna meeting earlier this month with complaints that the organisation had just endured one of its most contentious and least productive gatherings in many years. But that is only because the major oil players were not prepared to pretend that there was agreement on output quotas. With Iran chairing the meeting, an annoyed Venezuela in attendance and an embattled Libya looking on, it was much harder to get the group to put aside their differences and smile for the cameras. The Saudis have the most influence on price-moving output decisions and they increased production just as they had planned before the meeting proved so difficult. Economically stressed oil producers such as Iran and Venezuela always want higher oil prices. But the Saudis and other Gulf Co-operation Council producers maintain a longer-term moderating outlook and they are the ones with the spare capacity to make the difference.   Add that to your favourite economist’s projection on the softness of the global economy, and we may soon be asking whether or not this latest IEA move was worth it.

Newsweek   Robert Gates: America is losing its grip   John Barry and Tara McKelvey      27 June -- Aboard the Pentagon jet on his last foreign trip as secretary of defense, Robert Gates takes a moment to peer across the American horizon--and the view is dire: the U.S. is in danger of losing its supremacy on the global stage, he says.   \"I've spent my entire adult life with the United States as a superpower, and one that had no compunction about spending what it took to sustain that position,\" he tells NEWSWEEK, seated in the strategic communications center of the Boeing E-4B. \"It didn't have to look over its shoulder because our economy was so strong. This is a different time.\"  A pause.  \"To tell you the truth, that's one of the many reasons it's time for me to retire, because frankly I can't imagine being part of a nation, part of a government ... that's being forced to dramatically scale back our engagement with the rest of the world.\"  Such a statement--rather astonishing for the leader of the world's preeminent fighting force--may open the administration to charges of not believing in American exceptionalism, an opening the GOP is already trying to exploit. But these days Gates is less worried about political crossfire and more focused on the legacy of his own tenure, which bridged the presidencies of George W. Bush and Barack Obama. He is determined to define his own legacy as Pentagon boss, and eager to push back against one of the more vocal criticisms of his tenure: the belief among many liberals and some conservative budget hawks that in a time of deep indebtedness, he hasn't been willing to chop enough of a defense budget bloated by a decade of war.  Don't expect him to apologize. In Gates's mind, it's other political leaders with less experience who are confused.   \"Congress is all over the place,\" Gates says at one point. \"And the Republicans are a perfect example. I mean, you've got the budget hawks and then you've got the defense hawks within the same party. And so I think there is no consensus on a role in the world.\"   In some ways, the first part of his tenure was easier. During the Bush years, money was never an issue. By contrast, Obama faced a harsh economic reality, and Gates tried to get in front of the issue by shrinking the Pentagon budget. But his cuts satisfied neither hawks nor doves nor the White House. This spring, when Obama announced a $400 billion reduction in defense spending, Gates got just 24 hours' notice.  Gates, who'll be succeeded by CIA chief Leon Panetta, wins bipartisan accolades for restoring morale at the Pentagon and, more important, repairing relations with Congress, which had grown distrustful of the Defense Department under Rumsfeld.   Bridging two administrations, Gates gets credit for stabilizing Iraq, though the key decisions that led to success--a surge of troops and the appointment of Gen. David Petraeus to oversee the strategy--predated his arrival.   Petraeus says Gates knew that his real contribution was to buy time in Washington for the strategy to succeed. \" 'Your battle space is Iraq. My battle space is Washington,' \" Petraeus recalls Gates telling him.  Gates concedes he was sometimes on the wrong side of an issue. For instance, he was gun-shy about using ground troops to kill Osama bin Laden, arguing that Obama should opt for an airstrike instead. Gates hesitated because he feared a repeat of the bungled 1980 attempt to free American hostages in Iran that killed eight U.S. servicemen. \"I was very explicit with the president in one of the discussions,\" Gates acknowledges. \"I said: 'Mr. President, I want truth in lending. Because of experience, I may be too cautious, you know.'?\"   Obama overruled Gates, siding with those who wanted to deploy the elite Navy SEALs, securing the biggest victory in the 10-year war on terror.  Rather than a transformational figure, a more accurate description for Gates may be \"steady hand on the wheel,\" says the Foreign Policy Research Institute's Michael Noonan.   \"I don't think [Gates's] accomplishments merit the sky-high reputation that he enjoys as he leaves office,\" former senior CIA analyst Paul Pillar says. \"Gates has long had a knack for nurturing his own reputation.\"   Pillar recalls that Gates during his CIA days was \"always saying, 'I'm going to whip this organization into shape.' Anything good that happens, it's because 'I'm head of the organization.' Anything bad can be attributed to 'institutional resistance.'\"   When Gates took over the Pentagon in December 2006, he quickly demonstrated the diplomatic and political acumen he had acquired as he worked his way up through the intelligence community as the first career officer to become CIA director.   Take, for instance, his decision to court Hillary Clinton when she took over as secretary of state in 2009. One of the few senior Bush holdovers in the new Obama administration, Gates was keenly aware of the tensions between the State and Defense departments built up during the war in Iraq. He invited Clinton to his Pentagon office, and the two ate lunch at a table that belonged to Confederate President Jefferson Davis back when he was U.S. secretary of war.   \"I just told her, based on my experience, that how well the administration worked would depend a lot on how well she and I got along together,\" Gates recalls. \"If we got along, the message would go to the entire bureaucracy--not just our own bureaucracies but the rest of government as well. She totally understood.\"   Gates made a calculated--and more public--courtship of her entire agency. \"I read in the press, and therefore it must be true, that no secretary of defense had ever been quoted as arguing for a bigger budget for State,\" Gates boasts now.  The strategy worked. Clinton and Gates try to get together privatelyonce a week to work out differences between their departments, and working with a younger generation, the two have bonded.   \"Hillary and I call ourselves the Old Folks Caucus,\" Gates quips. \"And I must say, it's the first time in my life I've worked for a president who was 20 years younger than I was.\"   Gates's tenure had difficult moments, too. Three years ago, he rejected requests from Gen. David McKiernan, his then top commander in Afghanistan, for more troops, believing there weren't enough resources. Gates stayed the course until 2009, when he argued for the troop surge that now appears to have stalled the insurgency.   Gates acknowledges a historical similarity to the Vietnam War. \"There is one parallel that I think is appropriate, and that is we came to the right strategy and the right resources very late in the game,\" Gates says. \"President Obama, I think, got the right strategy and the right resources for Afghanistan--but eight years in.\"   In Afghanistan, Gates leaves behind a difficult, unfinished piece of business: to convince Congress and war-weary Americans that any major U.S. withdrawal should be delayed by a year--a deferment sought by military commanders on the ground. Likewise, Gates won't be around for what may be the most delicate aspect of the exit strategy--trying to broker reconciliation between the Taliban and the Afghan ruling parties aligned with the U.S.   \"I'm not saying it'll all be settled,\" says Gates. \"I'm just saying you could begin a serious dialogue by the end of the year.\" But, he concedes, \"asking for another year is hard.\"                \fArticle 7.   The National Interest    The Good Autocrat   Robert D. Kaplan      June 21, 2011 -- IN HIS extended essay, On Liberty, published in 1859, the English philosopher John Stuart Mill famously declares, “That the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others.” Mill’s irreducible refutation of tyranny leads him to—I have always felt—one of the most moving passages in literature, in which he extols the moral virtues of Marcus Aurelius, only to register the Roman’s supreme flaw. Mill writes:   If ever any one, possessed of power, had grounds for thinking himself the best and most enlightened among his contemporaries, it was the Emperor Marcus Aurelius. Absolute monarch of the whole civilized world, he preserved through life not only the most unblemished justice, but what was less to be expected from his Stoical breeding, the tenderest heart. The few failings which are attributed to him, were all on the side of indulgence: while his writings, the highest ethical product of the ancient mind, differ scarcely perceptibly, if they differ at all, from the most characteristic teachings of Christ.  And yet, as Mill laments, this “unfettered intellect,” this exemplar of humanism by second-century-AD standards, persecuted Christians. As deplorable a state as society was in at the time (wars, internal revolts, cruelty in all its manifestations), Marcus Aurelius assumed that what held it together and kept it from getting worse was the acceptance of the existing divinities, which the adherents of Christianity threatened to dissolve. He simply could not foresee a world knit together by new and better ties. “No Christian,” Mill writes, “more firmly believes that Atheism is false, and tends to the dissolution of society, than Marcus Aurelius believed the same things of Christianity.”   If even such a ruler as Marcus Aurelius could be so monumentally wrong, then no dictator, it would seem, no matter how benevolent, could ever ultimately be trusted in his judgment. It follows, therefore, that the persecution of an idea or ideals for the sake of the existing order can rarely be justified, since the existing order is itself suspect. And, pace Mill, if we can never know for certain if authority is in the right, even as anarchy must be averted, the only recourse for society is to be able to choose and regularly replace its forever-imperfect leaders.  But there is a catch. As Mill admits earlier in his essay,   Liberty, as a principle, has no application to any state of things anterior to the time when mankind have become capable of being improved by free and equal discussion. Until then, there is nothing . . . but implicit obedience to an Akbar or a Charlemagne, if they are so fortunate as to find one.   Indeed, Mill knows that authority has first to be created before we can go about limiting it. For without authority, however dictatorial, there is a fearful void, as we all know too well from Iraq in 2006 and 2007. In fact, no greater proponent of individual liberty than Isaiah Berlin himself observes in his introduction to Four Essays on Liberty that, “Men who live in conditions where there is not sufficient food, warmth, shelter, and the minimum degree of security can scarcely be expected to concern themselves with freedom of contract or of the press.” In “Two Concepts of Liberty,” Berlin allows that “First things come first: there are situations . . . in which boots are superior to the works of Shakespeare, individual freedom is not everyone’s primary need.” Further complicating matters, Berlin notes that “there is no necessary connection between individual liberty and democratic rule.” There might be a despot “who leaves his subjects a wide area of liberty” but cares “little for order, or virtue, or knowledge.” Clearly, just as there are good and bad popularly elected leaders, there are good and bad autocrats.  THE SIGNAL fact of the Arab world at the beginning of this year of democratic revolution was that, for the most part, it encompassed few of these subtleties and apparent contradictions. Middle Eastern societies had long since moved beyond basic needs of food and security to the point where individual freedom could easily be contemplated. After all, over the past half century, Arabs from the Maghreb to the Persian Gulf experienced epochal social, economic, technological and demographic transformation: it was only the politics that lagged behind. And while good autocrats there were, the reigning model was sterile and decadent national-security regimes, deeply corrupt and with sultanic tendencies. These leaders sought to perpetuate their rule through offspring: sons who had not risen through the military or other bureaucracies, and thus had no legitimacy. Marcus Aurelius was one thing; Tunisia’s Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, Egypt’s Hosni Mubarak and Syria’s Bashar al-Assad, quite another. Certainly, the Arab Spring has proved much: that there is no otherness to Arab civilization, that Arabs yearn for universal values just as members of other societies do. But as to difficult questions regarding the evolution of political order and democracy, it has in actuality proved very little. To wit, no good autocrats were overthrown. The regimes that have fallen so far had few saving graces in any larger moral or philosophical sense, and the wonder is how they lasted as long as they did, even as their tumultuous demise was sudden and unexpected.  Yet, the issues about which Mill and Berlin cared so passionately must still be addressed. For in some places in the Arab world, and particularly in Asia, there have been autocrats who can, in fact, be spoken of in the same breath as Marcus Aurelius. So at what point is it right or practical to oust these rulers? It is quite possible to force through political change, which leads, contrary to aims, into a more deeply oppressive, militarized or, perhaps worse, anarchic environment. Indeed, as Berlin intimates, what follows dictatorial rule will not inevitably further the cause of individual liberty and well-being. Absent relentless, large-scale human-rights violations, soft landings for nondemocratic regimes are always preferable to hard ones, even if the process takes some time. A moral argument can be made that monsters like Muammar el-Qaddafi in Libya and Kim Jong-il in North Korea should be overthrown any way they can, as fast as we can, regardless of the risk of short-term chaos. But that reasoning quickly loses its appeal when one is dealing with dictators who are less noxious. And even when they are not less noxious, as in the case of Iraq’s Saddam Hussein, the moral argument for their removal is still fraught with difficulty since the worse the autocrat, the worse the chaos left in his wake. That is because a bad dictator eviscerates intermediary institutions between the regime at the top and the extended family or tribe at the bottom—professional associations, community organizations, political groups and so on—the very stuff of civil society. The good dictator, by fostering economic growth, among other things, makes society more complex, leading to more civic groupings and to political divisions based on economic interest that are by definition more benign than tribal, ethnic or sectarian divides. A good dictator can be defined as one who makes his own removal less rife with risk.  While the logical conclusion of Mill’s essay is to deny the moral right of dictatorship, his admission of the need for obedience to an Akbar or a Charlemagne at primitive levels of social development leaves one facing the larger question: Is transition from autocracy to democracy always virtuous? For there is a vast difference between the rule of even a wise and enlightened individual like the late-sixteenth-century Mogul Akbar the Great and a society so free that coercion of the individual by the state only ever occurs to prevent the harm of others. It is such a great disparity that Mill’s proposition that persecution to preserve the existing order can never be justified remains theoretical and may never be achieved; even democratic governments must coerce their citizens for a variety of reasons. Nevertheless, the ruler who moves society to a more advanced stage of development is not only good but also perhaps the most necessary of historical actors—to the extent that history is determined by freewilled individuals as well as by larger geographical and economic forces. And the good autocrat, I submit, is not a contradiction in terms; rather, he stands at the center of the political questions that continuously morphing political societies face.   GOOD AUTOCRATS there are. For example, in the Middle East, monarchy has found a way over the decades and centuries to engender a political legitimacy of its own, allowing leaders like King Mohammed VI in Morocco, King Abdullah in Jordan and Sultan Qaboos bin Said in Oman to grant their subjects a wide berth of individual liberties without fear of being overthrown. Not only is relative freedom allowed, but extremist politics and ideologies are unnecessary in these countries.  It is only in modernizing dictatorships like Syria and Libya—which in historical and geographical terms are artificial constructions and whose rulers are inherently illegitimate—where brute force and radicalism are required to hold the state together. To be sure, Egypt’s Mubarak and Tunisia’s Ben Ali neither ran police states on the terrifying scale of Libya’s Qaddafi and Syria’s Assad nor stifled economic progress with such alacrity. But while Mubarak and Ben Ali left their countries in conditions suitable for the emergence of stable democracy, there is little virtue that can be attached to their rule. The economic liberalizations of recent years were haphazard rather than well planned. Their countries’ functioning institutions exist for reasons that go back centuries: Egypt and Tunisia have been states in one form or another since antiquity. Moreover, the now-fallen dictators promoted a venal system of corruption built on personal access to their own ruling circles. And Mubarak, rather than move society forward by dispensing with a pseudomonarchical state, sought to move it backward by installing his son in power. Mubarak and Ben Ali were dull men, enabled by goons in the security services. The real story in the Middle East these past few months, beyond the toppling of these decrepit regimes, is the possible emergence of authentic constitutional monarchies in places like Morocco and Oman.  Both of these countries, which lie at the two geographical extremities of the Arab world, have not been immune to demonstrations. But the protesters in both cases have explicitly called for reform and democracy within the royal system and have supported the leaders themselves. King Mohammed and Sultan Qaboos have moved vigorously to get out in front of popular demands by reforming their systems instead of merely firing their cabinets. Indeed, over the years, they have championed women’s rights, the environment, the large-scale building of schools and other progressive causes. Qaboos, in particular, is sort of a Renaissance man who plays the lute and loves Western classical music, and who—at least until the celebrations in 2010 marking forty years of his rule—eschewed a personality cult. The characteristics, then, of the benign dictator are evident, at times hewing to propositions set forth by the likes of Berlin: freedom may come as much from stability as from democracy; leaders must adhere to the will of the people, they need not in all cases be chosen by them. Yet in the Middle East these dictators remain the exception to the rule, and this is why quasi monarchies of the iron-fisted Assad or the crazed and tyrannical Qaddafi are now under assault.  THE PLACE where benevolent autocracy has struck deep and has systematic roots is Asia. Any discussion of whether and how democracy can be successfully implemented might, because of the current headlines, begin with the Arab world, but the answers such as there are will, nevertheless, ultimately come in from the East. It is in those Asian lands that conventional Western philosophical precepts are challenged.  The ideology by which Asian autocrats stand in opposition to the likes of Mill and Berlin falls—to some extent—under the rubric of Confucianism. Confucianism is more a sensibility than a political doctrine. It stresses traditional authority, particularly that of the family, as the sine qua non of political tranquility. The well-being of the community takes precedence over that of the individual. Morality is inseparable from one’s social obligation to the kin group and the powers that be. The Western—and particularly the American—tendency is to be suspicious of power and central authority; whereas the Asian tendency is to worry about disorder. Thus, it is in Asia, much more so than in the Middle East, where autocracy can give the Western notion of freedom a good run for its money. The fact that even a chaotic democracy is better than the rule of a Mubarak or a Ben Ali proves nothing. But is a chaotic democracy better than the rule of autocrats who have overseen GDP growth rates of 10 percent annually over the past three decades? It is in places like China, Singapore, Malaysia and Vietnam where good dictators have produced economic miracles. These in turn have led to the creation of wide-ranging personal freedoms, even as these leaders have compelled people against their will on a grand scale. Here the debate gets interesting.   Indeed, probably one of the most morally vexing realizations in the field of international politics is that Deng Xiaoping, by dramatically raising the living standard of hundreds of millions of Chinese in such a comparatively short space of time—which, likewise, led to an unforeseen explosion in personal freedoms across China—was, despite the atrocity of Tiananmen Square that he helped perpetrate, one of the great men of the twentieth century. Deng’s successors, though repressive of political rights, have adhered to his grand strategy of seeking natural resources anywhere in the world, wherever they can find them, caring not with which despots they do business, in order to continue to raise the economic status of their own people. These Chinese autocrats govern in a collegial fashion, number many an engineer and technocrat among them, and observe strict retirement ages: this is all a far cry from the king of Saudi Arabia and the deposed leader of Egypt, sleepy octogenarians both, whose skills for creating modern middle-class societies are for the most part nonexistent.   Park Chung Hee, in the 1960s and 1970s, literally built, institutionalized and industrialized the South Korean state. It was Park Chung Hee’s benign authoritarianism, as much as the democracy that eventually followed him, that accounts for the political-economic powerhouse that is today’s South Korea.   Then, of course, there is the founder of current-day Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew. In 1959, Lee became prime minister of what was then a British colony. He retired from that post over thirty years later (though he continued to exert significant power until very recently). As the British prepared to withdraw in the 1960s, Lee attached Singapore to Malaya, helping to form Malaysia as a bulwark against Indonesian expansionism. When racial tensions between ethnic Malays in the Malay Peninsula and ethnic Chinese in Singapore made the new federation unworkable, Lee seceded and the independent city-state of Singapore was born. When Lee assumed power, Singapore was literally a third-world malarial hellhole beset by ethnic tensions and communist tendencies; it was barely a country in any psychological sense and it certainly could not defend itself against powerful neighbors. Lee turned it into a first-world technological dynamo and transportation hub, with one of the highest living standards worldwide, and with a military that is among the best anywhere pound for pound. Along the way, a strong national consciousness was forged in the vein of a twenty-first-century trading state. Lee’s method of government was not altogether democratic, and his intrusion into people’s lives bordered on the petty and anal-retentive: banning spitting, the use of tobacco and chewing gum. The press, of course, was tightly controlled. Whenever criticized, Lee scoffed at how an uninhibited media in India, the Philippines and Thailand had not spared those countries from rampant corruption; multinationals love Singapore in large measure because of its meritocracy and honest government. Yes, Singapore is green with many parks, and so immaculate it borders on the antiseptic. But it is also a controlled society that challenges ideals of the Western philosophers.   For Lee has provided for the well-being of his citizens without really relying on democracy. His example holds out the possibility, heretical to an enlightened Western mind, that democracy may not be the last word in human political development. What he has engineered in Singapore is a hybrid regime: capitalistic it is, but it all occurred—particularly in the early decades—in a quasi-authoritarian setting. Elections are held, but the results are never in doubt. There may be consultations with various political groupings, yet, in fifty years, there is still little sign that the population is fundamentally unhappy with the ruling People’s Action Party (though its majority has fallen somewhat). Unsurprisingly, Lee makes liberals supremely uncomfortable. Fundamentally Mill, Berlin and many other Western philosophical theorists and political scientists—from Thomas Paine and John Locke to Francis Fukuyama of late—hold that people will eventually wish to wrest themselves from the shackles of repressive rule. That the innate human desire for free will inevitably engenders discontent with the ruling class from below—something we have seen in abundance in the lands of the Arab Spring. Yet, Confucian-based societies see not oppression in reasonably exercised authority but respect; they see lack of political power not as subjugation but as order. Of course, this is provided we are talking about a Deng or a Lee and not a Pol Pot.   To be sure, Asian autocracies are not summarily successful. Elsewhere, political Confucianism is messier. In Malaysia, Mahathir bin Mohamad lifted his people out of abject poverty and easygoing cronyism to mold another high-tech, first-world miracle; but he lacks virtue because of the tactics he employed as methods of control: vicious campaigns against human-rights activists and intimidation of political opponents, which included character assassination. The Vietnamese Communist leadership has lately overseen dynamic economic growth, with, again, the acceleration of personal freedoms, even as corruption and inequalities remain rampant. Think for a moment of Vietnam, a society that has gone from rationing books to enjoying one of the largest rice surpluses in the world in a quarter of a century. It recently graduated in statistical terms to a middle-income country with a per capita GDP of $1,100. Instead of a single personality with his picture on billboards to hate, as has been the case in Egypt, Syria and other Arab countries, there is a faceless triumvirate of leaders—the party chairman, the state president and the prime minister—that has delivered an average of 9 percent growth in GDP annually over the past decade. Nevertheless, Vietnam’s rulers remain fearful of public displays of dissatisfaction spread across the Internet. And there is China: continental in size, it produces vastly different local conditions with which a central authority must grapple. Such grappling puts pressure on a regime to grant more rights to its far-flung subjects; or, that being resisted, to become by degrees more authoritarian. So terrified is its regime of its own version of an Arab Spring that it has gone to absurd lengths to block social media and politically provocative areas of the Web.   HERE IS the dilemma. Yes, a social contract of sorts exists between these citizens and their regimes: in return for impressive economic-growth rates the people agree to forego their desire to replace their leaders. (Truly, East Asian autocracies have not robbed people of their dignity the way Middle Eastern ones have.) But even as such growth rates continue unabated—to say nothing of if they collapse or even slow down—at higher income levels, this social contract may peter out. For as people become middle class, they gain access to global culture and trends, which prompts a desire for political freedoms to go along with their personal ones. This is why authoritarian capitalism may be just a phase, rather than a viable alternative to Western democracy.   To be sure, once the basic issues of food and security have been addressed, pace Mill and Berlin, democracy retains a better possibility of getting it right than autocracy. This is because virtuous autocracies are hard to come by and usually rely on the genius of personality; whereas democracy, regardless of the personalities involved, is systemically better positioned to lead citizenries along the path of development. Of course, we will have to wait until China’s economic growth slows down, or, failing that, continues until enough Chinese have more access to global culture. Only then can we really begin to draw conclusions about whether democracy represents the final triumph of reason in politics.   The genius of both Rome and America lies ultimately in their institutions, which allowed in the first place for their freedoms. True, the history of Rome—and particularly the death of the Roman Republic—is not in the least uplifting relative to the cause of political expression. But it was Rome’s ability to provide a modicum of stability to parts of central Europe and the entire Mediterranean basin—and thus further the cause of personal freedoms (mind you, by the dismal standards of the era)—that is key to its achievement; and something which, in turn, is owed to its imperial superstructure. And as that superstructure became too unwieldy, an emperor like the gruff soldier Diocletian could allow for the division of the empire itself into several administrative parts, thus furthering its life span. America, for its part, is unique in its division of federal, state and local power over a vast continental landscape, allowing for the full expression of its boisterous democracy. Say what you will about the deficiencies of the United States and particularly those of Rome, but they both indicate a very difficult truth central to the outcome of the Arab Spring: it is not about the expressions of freedom in Tahrir Square so much as it is about the building of legitimate institutions to replace illegitimate ones. And because institutions are hierarchical—and social media like Twitterand Facebookdismantle existing hierarchies—revolutions enabled by new technology do not necessarily lead to the building of governing organizations. Criticism is not enough, someone must wield power; hopefully in a way less coercive than before.   Meanwhile, the Arab Spring has raised the pressure on autocrats the world over to truly be good—or at least better. Though, even if they are, they can never ultimately get it right, as demonstrated by Mill’s example of Marcus Aurelius.      Robert D.

Thousands of new cars are plying the roads. A second shopping mall — with escalators imported from Israel — will open next month. Hundreds of homes and two dozen schools are about to go up. A Hamas-run farm where Jewish settlements once stood is producing enough fruit that Israeli imports are tapering off. \n\n\nAs pro-Palestinian activists prepare to set sail aboard a flotilla aimed at maintaining an international spotlight on Gaza and pressure on Israel, this isolated Palestinian coastal enclave is experiencing its first real period of economic growth since the siege they are protesting began in 2007. \n\n\n“Things are better than a year ago,” said Jamal El-Khoudary, chairman of the board of the Islamic University, who has led Gaza’s Popular Committee Against the Siege. “The siege on goods is now 60 to 70 percent over.” \n\n\nAla al-Rafati, the economy minister for Hamas, the militant group that governs Gaza, said in an interview that nearly 1,000 factories are operating here, and he estimated unemployment at no more than 25 percent after a sharp drop in jobless levels in the first quarter of this year. “Yesterday alone, the Gaza municipality launched 12 projects for paving roads, digging wells and making gardens,” he said. \n\n\nSo is that the news from Gaza in mid-2011? Yes, but so is this: Thousands of homes that were destroyed in the Israeli antirocket invasion two and a half years ago have not been rebuilt. Hospitals have canceled elective surgery for lack of supplies. Electricity remains maddeningly irregular. The much-publicized opening of the Egyptian border has fizzled, so people remain trapped here. The number of residents living on less than $1.60 a day has tripled in four years. Three-quarters of the population rely on food aid. \n\n\nAreas with as contested a history as this one can choose among anniversaries to commemorate. It has been four years since Hamas took over, prompting Israel and Egypt to impose a blockade on people and most goods. It is a year since a Turkish flotilla challenged the siege and Israeli commandos killed nine activists aboard the ships, leading to international outrage and an easing of conditions. And it is five years since an Israeli soldier, Staff Sgt. Gilad Shalit, was abducted and held in captivity without even visits from the Red Cross. \n\n\nIn assessing the condition of the 1.6 million people who live in Gaza, there are issues of where to draw the baseline and — often — what motivates the discussion. It has never been among the world’s poorest places. There is near universal literacy and relatively low infant mortality, and health conditions remain better than across much of the developing world. \n\n\n“We have 100 percent vaccination; no polio, measles, diphtheria or AIDS,” said Mahmoud Daher, a World Health Organization official here. “We’ve never had a cholera outbreak.” \n\n\nThe Israeli government and its defenders use such data to portray Gaza as doing just fine and Israeli policy as humane and appropriate: no flotillas need set sail. \n\n\nIsrael’s critics say the fact that the conditions in Gaza do not rival the problems in sub-Saharan Africa only makes the political and human rights crisis here all the more tragic — and solvable. Israel, they note, still controls access to sea, air and most land routes, and its security policies have consciously strangled development opportunities for an educated and potentially high-achieving population that is trapped with no horizon. Pressure needs to be maintained to end the siege entirely, they say, and talk of improvement is counterproductive. \n\n\nThe recent changes stem from a combination of Israeli policy shifts and the chaos in Egypt. The new Egyptian border policy has made little difference, but Egypt’s revolution and its reduced policing in the Sinai have had a profound effect. \n\n\nFor the past year, Israel has allowed most everything into Gaza but cement, steel and other construction material — other than for internationally supervised projects — because they are worried that such supplies can be used by Hamas for bunkers and bombs. A number of international projects are proceeding, but there is an urgent need for housing, street paving, schools, factories and public works projects, all under Hamas or the private sector, and Israel’s policy bans access to the goods to move those forward. \n\n\nSo in recent months, tunnels under the southern border that were used to bring in consumer goods have become almost fully devoted to smuggling in building materials. \n\n\nSacks of cement and piles of gravel, Turkish in origin and bought legally in Egypt, are smuggled through the hundreds of tunnels in double shifts, day and night, totaling some 3,000 tons a day. Since the overthrow of President Hosni Mubarak, the Egyptian security authorities no longer stop the smugglers. Streets are being paved and buildings constructed. \n\n\n“Mubarak was crushing us before,” said Mahmoud Mohammad, a subcontractor whose 10-man crew in Gaza City was unloading steel bars that were carried through the tunnels and were destined for a new restaurant. “Last year we were sitting at home. The contractor I work for has three major projects going.” \n\n\nNearby, Amer Selmi was supervising the building of a three-story, $2 million wedding hall. Most of his materials come from the tunnels. \n\n\nKarim Gharbawi is an architect and building designer with 10 projects under way, all of them eight- and nine-story residential properties. He said there were some 130 engineering and design firms in Gaza. Two years ago, none were working. Today, he said, all of them are. \n\n\nAnother result of the regional changes is the many new cars here. Israel allows in 20 a week, but that does not meet the need. Hundreds of BMWs, pickup trucks and other vehicles have arrived in recent months from Libya, driven through Egypt and sold via the unmonitored tunnels. Dozens of white Kia Sportage models, ubiquitous on the street, are widely thought to have come from the same dealership in Benghazi, Libya, that was looted after the uprising there began. \n\n\nHamas’s control of Gaza appears firmer than ever, and the looser tunnel patrols in Egypt mean greater access to weapons as well. But opinion surveys show that its more secular rival, Fatah, is more popular. That may explain why an attempt at political unity with Fatah is moving slowly: the Hamas leaders here are likely to lose their jobs. The hospital supply crisis is a direct result of tensions with Fatah in the West Bank, which has kept the supplies from being shipped here. \n\n\nEfforts by fringe Islamist groups to challenge Hamas have had little effect. And it has been a year since the government unsuccessfully sought to impose tighter religious restrictions by banning women from smoking water pipes in public. On a recent afternoon in the new Carino’s restaurant — with billiards, enormous flat-screen televisions, buttery-soft chairs — women without head coverings were smoking freely. \n\n\nBut such places and people represent a wafer-thin slice of Gazan society, and focusing on them distorts the broader and grimmer picture. \n\n\nSamah Saleh is a 21-year-old medical student who lives in the Jabaliya refugee camp.

What is described in some quarters as a recipe for new strife and confrontation can actually be leveraged into a win-win situation for Israelis, Palestinians and the world. \n\n\nThe Palestinians under Mahmoud Abbas want the United Nations to grant them a sovereign state based on the 1967 boundaries with East Jerusalem as its capital. That’s all. It is not asking the U.N. to solve the refugee /right-of-return issue or to determine who owns the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. It is opting to convert an intractable conflict between a state and a liberation movement into a state-to-state conflict with manageable parameters. \n\n\nWhy not offer the Palestinians what they want, but add elements that could render the resolution acceptable to a majority of Israelis? \n\n\nIsrael wants acceptance as a Jewish state with its recognized capital in Jerusalem. It needs assurances regarding the nature and priorities of future negotiations, with the truly intractable issues postponed to a later phase. It needs solid security arrangements, understandings regarding Hamas rule in Gaza, and a viable incentive from an Arab world that has long offered to reward it for moving forward with the Palestinians. \n\n\nHere are the components of a possible “win-win” U.N. resolution regarding Palestinian statehood: \n\n\n• Reaffirm support for the resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict on the basis of two states for two peoples and the right of the Jewish and Palestinian peoples to self-determination, without prejudice to the rights of all citizens and minority groups. Recall, in this context, U.N. General Assembly resolution 181 of 1947 that called for the establishment of a Jewish state and an Arab state. \n\n\n• Acknowledge institutional and security reform, economic development and state-building efforts — especially in the West Bank, under the leadership of President Abbas and Prime Minister Salam Fayyad, which have helped lay the foundations for Palestinian statehood — and endorse the position articulated by the World Bank and the United Nations that the Palestinian Authority is “well positioned for the establishment of a state at any point in the near future.” \n\n\n• Accordingly, support the establishment of an independent and sovereign Palestinian state on the basis of the 1967 lines with its capital in East Jerusalem in parallel with Israel’s recognized capital in West Jerusalem, and with mutually agreed territorial swaps and modifications, subject to negotiation — a state that will live side by side with Israel in peace and security. \n\n\n• Recognize that extending the authority of a Palestinian state to the Gaza Strip will depend on effective control there by a legitimate Palestinian government that exercises authority in the West Bank, is committed to the Quartet principles and the Arab Peace Initiative and respects the commitments of the Palestine Liberation Organization. \n\n\n• Call for both states to engage in good faith negotiations on the basis of this and previous relevant resolutions and agreements in order to resolve all outstanding issues between them, beginning with the issues of borders, settlements, water and security arrangements. Specifically, security arrangements — including multi-layered international, regional and bilateral guarantees — should confront and neutralize threats and enable the phased withdrawal of Israeli forces from a demilitarized Palestinian state with an effective internal security force and without compromising Israeli security. \n\n\n• Note the importance of the Arab Peace Initiative, endorsed by the Arab League in 2002, and call for regional states to assist in creating an atmosphere conducive to negotiation and agreement, including by intensifying efforts to advance coexistence and normalization of relations between Arab League members and Israel. \n\n\nA creative and courageous approach to leveraging the Palestinian initiative will not end the conflict. But it could make it far more manageable. \n\n\n\n\n\nYossi Alpher coedits bitterlemons.net and is former director of the Jaffee Center at Tel Aviv University.

Khouri\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 25, 2011 -- My pleasure at speaking this week in Ottawa at a gathering at the International Development Research Center of Canada was compounded by the very thoughtful questions and comments that members of the audience offered.\n\n\nThe audience raised new questions in my mind about what is likely or possibly may occur in the Arab region, as the current citizen revolt moves into its seventh month. The issues they raised revolved around the reality that there is no certain outcome to the developments in assorted Arab countries. While I and many other Arab citizens feel that the wave of democratic transformations will continue to wash across most of the region, sweeping away old and young autocrats and opening the door to new democracies, this is by no means certain.\n\n\nEconomic pressures, for one, could easily create such immense stresses on families that many Arabs who celebrated the Tunisian and Egyptian regime changes may welcome the return of strongmen who restrict citizens’ powers but provide more jobs. I doubt this will happen, but we can never rule it out. The demands of children’s stomachs crying out for food that many families cannot afford to buy are immensely powerful drivers of political behavior.\n\n\nAnother threat that some audience members raised was related to the potential break-up of some countries into smaller units that could be more easily controlled by regional or foreign powers. The first Arab revolt against the Ottomans around a century ago occurred simultaneously with the Sykes-Picot accord, by which France and Great Britain carved up the Arab east into smaller units that were put under the rule of locally chosen leaders whom the Europeans knew they could trust. It is possible that the current transformations might result in security vacuums that local parties or foreign powers could exploit to fragment some Arab states into smaller units that would then be more reliant on foreign support or protection.\n\n\nSudan has already split into northern and southern states, while Yemen, Iraq and possibly a few others are similarly susceptible to subdivision into smaller statelets. This raises difficult issues about the inviolability of the current Arab borders that the retreating Europeans created last century. I thought the secession of South Sudan was a perfectly acceptable development, if it reflected the will of the people of the south, and was not imposed on them. The operative principle in such possible developments is whether change reflects the consent of the governed and represents the will of the majority, while protecting the rights of minorities. If Yemenis decide to split again into two or even three states, and this reflects the free will of the Yemeni people, they should be allowed to do so without external interference.\n\n\nThere is nothing sacred or permanent about the borders of any country, especially Arab countries that were mostly created by the handiwork of European colonial officers. Countries evolve and sometimes change shape as a routine historical process. If some Arabs decide they are uncomfortable with their existing state boundaries and they wish to break away and form a separate country, that should always be an option. After all, the world mostly rejoiced when the former Soviet Union and its empire collapsed and some of its constituent republics fragmented into smaller units, notably Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia.\n\n\nWe should be prepared to deal with the specter of existing Arab countries that reconfigure their frontiers and populations while they are reconfiguring their political governance systems.\n\n\nAnother point that was raised in several different forms related to how the current Arab revolt would affect relations with major Western countries, especially since many Western powers actively supported the Arab autocrats who are now being challenged and, in some cases, removed from office. Would newly liberated Arab citizenries seek revenge against Western powers?\n\n\nMy impression is that this will depend on the new policies that these Western powers adopt, rather than on what they did in the past. Most Arabs are critical of Western powers because they unquestioningly back Israel or support Arab autocrats. Should those policies be moderated and replaced by more even-handed postures toward the Middle East, newly liberated Arab citizens would probably be too busy building their new countries to allow themselves to be distracted by lingering resentments from the past.\n\n\nWhat is the single most important development that could trigger regime change in some countries now facing domestic challenges and unrest, one person asked? Three reasons come to mind: economic collapse could do so; or key figures in the military and security agencies could stop protecting the regime; or strategically placed commercial, tribal, sectarian and business leaders in society could decide that the current course was disastrous and, in consequence, could bring about the fall of the regime.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\fArticle 4.\n\n\nGuardian\n\n\nWhy Israel is wrong about Iran\n\n\nMeir Javedanfar \n\n\n\n\n\n25 June 2011 -- Israel's former intelligence chief, Meir Dagan, has been subjected to a firestorm of criticism – from the Israeli government as well as sections of the media – since he stated that attacking Iran's nuclear installations would be \"a stupid idea\".\n\n\nSo strong has been the reaction that the prime minister's office even asked him to return his diplomatic passport. What seems to be bothering some Israelis, including Ari Shavit, the respected Haaretz journalist, is that Dagan has now \"made the Iranians think they can continue galloping to the bomb because they are not in any real danger\".  This claim, though, is a clear example of where some in Israel are getting it wrong with regard to Iran and what the Iranian leadership perceives as serious threats.  Israel has to realise that the Tehran regime is more petrified by what is happening to its economy and among its own population than by the possibility of a military attack from Israel. When it comes to using violence, this regime has had 32 years of experience. It can cope. However, the regime is so frightened of its own population that it breaks up silent demonstrations. It panicked when the shooting of Neda Agha Soltan was filmed and broadcast to the world. It even went as far as to temporarily ban books by Paulo Coelho – simply because his editor in Iran, Arash Hejazi, was seen trying to save Neda's life.\n\n\nDagan could be wrong in his assessment but, even if he is right, it does not mean that cessation of a military threat from Israel would induce the Iranian government to \"gallop ahead\" towards the bomb without any concern.   The biggest reason why Iran's supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, has agreed to talks during the last few years is not the fear of a military attack by Israel. The biggest reason is that he is worried about his country's economy, which is far more crucial to the regime's survival than the nuclear programme. The Islamic regime in Iran has not and will not live on its nuclear programme. It lives on its economy.  Khamenei is worried that if he doesn't negotiate, the west will find it easier to justify isolating his country. This, in turn, will make it easier to gain international approval for tough economic sanctions.  With so much legitimacy lost domestically after Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's controversial election in 2009, Khamenei has even more reason to worry about the impact that sanctions could have on the survival of his regime. This is the main reason why he is negotiating and will continue to do so. This is also why he will be careful, as he was before Dagan's statement, in the way he approaches his nuclear programme.  One also has to ask: which is the bigger reason why the international community is becoming more united against Iran's nuclear programme? Its distaste and concern for Khamanei's desire to have access to a bomb (which is becoming more apparent from clause 35 of the most recent IAEA report), or threats by Israel to attack Iran's nuclear installations? After recent revelations, such as the secret enrichment site near Qom, the former is more true.  To deal with such a regime and to confront its controversial nuclear programme, instead of constantly relying on military threats, Israel's leaders would be better advised to study Coelho's masterpiece, The Alchemist, and page 121 in particular: \n\n\n\"When you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.\"\n\n\nIsrael is no longer alone in its belief that Iran wants to build a bomb. Judging by the support for sanctions, the UN and especially its security council members are more on the side of Israel than Iran. This includes countries such as South Korea that have adopted unilateral sanctions against Iran.  In its bid to stop Iran's nuclear programme Israel should help itself and the international community. The most potent way would be by improving relations with the Islamic world, especially the PLO and Turkey. Israel had good relations with them before. It can do so again.\n\n\nFortunately for Israel, and unfortunately for Khamenei, Israel even has the option to hurt the regime on its very own streets.\n\n\nThat option is the cessation of verbal military threats against Iran. Cessation of military threats from Israel will make it much harder for the regime to divert the public's attention away from its falling popularity and serious domestic problems. Silence from Israel will make Iran's leaders more worried, as it will rob Khamenei from an important tool which has helped him, and at a crucial time when the regime is hemorrhaging legitimacy and popularity at an unprecedented rate. The damage such an endeavour will cause is worth the inconvenience of Israeli politicians having to bite their tongues.   Cessation of verbal threats will also prevent significant future damage being caused to Israel's deterrence posture if, at the end of the day, it decides to not to attack Iran's nuclear installations.\n\n\nCoelho once said: \n\n\n\"Be careful. You can hurt with your words, but you can also hurt with your silence.\"\n\n\nThe words of a wise man.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeir Javedanfar is an Iranian-Israeli Middle East analyst and co-author of The Nuclear Sphinx of Tehran: Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and the State of Iran.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\fArticle 5.\n\n\nThe Financial Time\n\n\nGlobal oil supplies are healthier than they seem \n\n\nIan Bremmer\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 24, 2011 -- Many of the world’s oil consuming nations, led by the US, shocked oil markets this week as the International Energy Agency agreed to release 60m barrels of oil from strategic reserves over the coming month. The move was intended to offset price pressures brought about by Libya’s supply cut and comes in response to Opecs recent inability to formally endorse new supply increases. The IEA action is also an example of growing concern over higher oil prices in Washington, where the White House is managing political fallout from high gasoline prices as next year’s presidential elections loom just over the horizon.   Yet, a year from now, we’re likely to look back on this moment and find that fears for supply have diminished. There are three reasons.   First, the most substantial fallout from the Arab world’s recent upheaval is behind us. Syria’s Bashar al-Assad continues to  fight for survival and Yemen continues to flirt with failed-state status, but the Gulf’s major oil-producing states are quite stable. So are other major producers. Even in Iran, with its leaders infighting, the green revolution has moved off the streets for now. While there are plenty of long-term structural challenges for many major economies ﻿– just ask China – for the moment there are no more Libyas left to explode. IEA action and the ongoing Saudi supply increases will neutralise what remains of the oil price’s political risk premium.   Second, big additional supply is coming, and it’s not all priced in. Offshore Brazil and Canadian oil sands are no longer new stories, but their collective impact has not yet been fully felt and is often undervalued. Iraq still draws undue scepticism but production there is showing serious promise. The country could add up to 300,000 barrels this year, with more contracts, more exploration and more drilling already in the works. Barring an unlikely and total implosion of the government, it is hard to see production slowing down this decade. The same is true for “tight oil” coming from unconventional sources. We are seeing this begin to play out in North American fields such as the Bakken in North Dakota. As technology and investment are dispersed over the coming year, oil supply should positively surprise.   Third, Saudi supply increases are not dependant on Opec. The country’s oil minister Ali Naimi left the cartel’s Vienna meeting earlier this month with complaints that the organisation had just endured one of its most contentious and least productive gatherings in many years. But that is only because the major oil players were not prepared to pretend that there was agreement on output quotas. With Iran chairing the meeting, an annoyed Venezuela in attendance and an embattled Libya looking on, it was much harder to get the group to put aside their differences and smile for the cameras. The Saudis have the most influence on price-moving output decisions and they increased production just as they had planned before the meeting proved so difficult. Economically stressed oil producers such as Iran and Venezuela always want higher oil prices. But the Saudis and other Gulf Co-operation Council producers maintain a longer-term moderating outlook and they are the ones with the spare capacity to make the difference.   Add that to your favourite economist’s projection on the softness of the global economy, and we may soon be asking whether or not this latest IEA move was worth it.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe writer is the president of Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy, and author of ‘The End of the Free Market’. \n\n\n\n\fArticle 6.\n\n\nNewsweek\n\n\nRobert Gates: America is losing its grip\n\n\nJohn Barry and Tara McKelvey\n\n\n\n\n\n27 June -- Aboard the Pentagon jet on his last foreign trip as secretary of defense, Robert Gates takes a moment to peer across the American horizon--and the view is dire: the U.S. is in danger of losing its supremacy on the global stage, he says.\n\n\n\"I've spent my entire adult life with the United States as a superpower, and one that had no compunction about spending what it took to sustain that position,\" he tells NEWSWEEK, seated in the strategic communications center of the Boeing E-4B. \"It didn't have to look over its shoulder because our economy was so strong. This is a different time.\"  A pause.  \"To tell you the truth, that's one of the many reasons it's time for me to retire, because frankly I can't imagine being part of a nation, part of a government ... that's being forced to dramatically scale back our engagement with the rest of the world.\"  Such a statement--rather astonishing for the leader of the world's preeminent fighting force--may open the administration to charges of not believing in American exceptionalism, an opening the GOP is already trying to exploit. But these days Gates is less worried about political crossfire and more focused on the legacy of his own tenure, which bridged the presidencies of George W. Bush and Barack Obama. He is determined to define his own legacy as Pentagon boss, and eager to push back against one of the more vocal criticisms of his tenure: the belief among many liberals and some conservative budget hawks that in a time of deep indebtedness, he hasn't been willing to chop enough of a defense budget bloated by a decade of war.  Don't expect him to apologize. In Gates's mind, it's other political leaders with less experience who are confused.\n\n\n\"Congress is all over the place,\" Gates says at one point. \"And the Republicans are a perfect example. I mean, you've got the budget hawks and then you've got the defense hawks within the same party. And so I think there is no consensus on a role in the world.\"\n\n\nIn some ways, the first part of his tenure was easier. During the Bush years, money was never an issue. By contrast, Obama faced a harsh economic reality, and Gates tried to get in front of the issue by shrinking the Pentagon budget. But his cuts satisfied neither hawks nor doves nor the White House. This spring, when Obama announced a $400 billion reduction in defense spending, Gates got just 24 hours' notice.  Gates, who'll be succeeded by CIA chief Leon Panetta, wins bipartisan accolades for restoring morale at the Pentagon and, more important, repairing relations with Congress, which had grown distrustful of the Defense Department under Rumsfeld.\n\n\nBridging two administrations, Gates gets credit for stabilizing Iraq, though the key decisions that led to success--a surge of troops and the appointment of Gen. David Petraeus to oversee the strategy--predated his arrival.   Petraeus says Gates knew that his real contribution was to buy time in Washington for the strategy to succeed. \" 'Your battle space is Iraq. My battle space is Washington,' \" Petraeus recalls Gates telling him.  Gates concedes he was sometimes on the wrong side of an issue. For instance, he was gun-shy about using ground troops to kill Osama bin Laden, arguing that Obama should opt for an airstrike instead. Gates hesitated because he feared a repeat of the bungled 1980 attempt to free American hostages in Iran that killed eight U.S. servicemen. \"I was very explicit with the president in one of the discussions,\" Gates acknowledges. \"I said: 'Mr. President, I want truth in lending. Because of experience, I may be too cautious, you know.'?\"   Obama overruled Gates, siding with those who wanted to deploy the elite Navy SEALs, securing the biggest victory in the 10-year war on terror.  Rather than a transformational figure, a more accurate description for Gates may be \"steady hand on the wheel,\" says the Foreign Policy Research Institute's Michael Noonan.\n\n\n\"I don't think [Gates's] accomplishments merit the sky-high reputation that he enjoys as he leaves office,\" former senior CIA analyst Paul Pillar says. \"Gates has long had a knack for nurturing his own reputation.\"\n\n\nPillar recalls that Gates during his CIA days was \"always saying, 'I'm going to whip this organization into shape.' Anything good that happens, it's because 'I'm head of the organization.' Anything bad can be attributed to 'institutional resistance.'\"\n\n\nWhen Gates took over the Pentagon in December 2006, he quickly demonstrated the diplomatic and political acumen he had acquired as he worked his way up through the intelligence community as the first career officer to become CIA director.\n\n\nTake, for instance, his decision to court Hillary Clinton when she took over as secretary of state in 2009. One of the few senior Bush holdovers in the new Obama administration, Gates was keenly aware of the tensions between the State and Defense departments built up during the war in Iraq. He invited Clinton to his Pentagon office, and the two ate lunch at a table that belonged to Confederate President Jefferson Davis back when he was U.S. secretary of war.\n\n\n\"I just told her, based on my experience, that how well the administration worked would depend a lot on how well she and I got along together,\" Gates recalls. \"If we got along, the message would go to the entire bureaucracy--not just our own bureaucracies but the rest of government as well. She totally understood.\"\n\n\nGates made a calculated--and more public--courtship of her entire agency. \"I read in the press, and therefore it must be true, that no secretary of defense had ever been quoted as arguing for a bigger budget for State,\" Gates boasts now.  The strategy worked. Clinton and Gates try to get together privatelyonce a week to work out differences between their departments, and working with a younger generation, the two have bonded.\n\n\n\"Hillary and I call ourselves the Old Folks Caucus,\" Gates quips. \"And I must say, it's the first time in my life I've worked for a president who was 20 years younger than I was.\"\n\n\nGates's tenure had difficult moments, too. Three years ago, he rejected requests from Gen. David McKiernan, his then top commander in Afghanistan, for more troops, believing there weren't enough resources. Gates stayed the course until 2009, when he argued for the troop surge that now appears to have stalled the insurgency.\n\n\nGates acknowledges a historical similarity to the Vietnam War. \"There is one parallel that I think is appropriate, and that is we came to the right strategy and the right resources very late in the game,\" Gates says. \"President Obama, I think, got the right strategy and the right resources for Afghanistan--but eight years in.\"\n\n\nIn Afghanistan, Gates leaves behind a difficult, unfinished piece of business: to convince Congress and war-weary Americans that any major U.S. withdrawal should be delayed by a year--a deferment sought by military commanders on the ground. Likewise, Gates won't be around for what may be the most delicate aspect of the exit strategy--trying to broker reconciliation between the Taliban and the Afghan ruling parties aligned with the U.S.\n\n\n\"I'm not saying it'll all be settled,\" says Gates. \"I'm just saying you could begin a serious dialogue by the end of the year.\" But, he concedes, \"asking for another year is hard.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\fArticle 7.\n\n\nThe National Interest \n\n\nThe Good Autocrat\n\n\nRobert D. Kaplan\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2011 -- IN HIS extended essay, On Liberty, published in 1859, the English philosopher John Stuart Mill famously declares, “That the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others.” Mill’s irreducible refutation of tyranny leads him to—I have always felt—one of the most moving passages in literature, in which he extols the moral virtues of Marcus Aurelius, only to register the Roman’s supreme flaw. Mill writes:\n\n\nIf ever any one, possessed of power, had grounds for thinking himself the best and most enlightened among his contemporaries, it was the Emperor Marcus Aurelius. Absolute monarch of the whole civilized world, he preserved through life not only the most unblemished justice, but what was less to be expected from his Stoical breeding, the tenderest heart. The few failings which are attributed to him, were all on the side of indulgence: while his writings, the highest ethical product of the ancient mind, differ scarcely perceptibly, if they differ at all, from the most characteristic teachings of Christ.  And yet, as Mill laments, this “unfettered intellect,” this exemplar of humanism by second-century-AD standards, persecuted Christians. As deplorable a state as society was in at the time (wars, internal revolts, cruelty in all its manifestations), Marcus Aurelius assumed that what held it together and kept it from getting worse was the acceptance of the existing divinities, which the adherents of Christianity threatened to dissolve. He simply could not foresee a world knit together by new and better ties. “No Christian,” Mill writes, “more firmly believes that Atheism is false, and tends to the dissolution of society, than Marcus Aurelius believed the same things of Christianity.”\n\n\nIf even such a ruler as Marcus Aurelius could be so monumentally wrong, then no dictator, it would seem, no matter how benevolent, could ever ultimately be trusted in his judgment. It follows, therefore, that the persecution of an idea or ideals for the sake of the existing order can rarely be justified, since the existing order is itself suspect. And, pace Mill, if we can never know for certain if authority is in the right, even as anarchy must be averted, the only recourse for society is to be able to choose and regularly replace its forever-imperfect leaders.  But there is a catch. As Mill admits earlier in his essay,\n\n\nLiberty, as a principle, has no application to any state of things anterior to the time when mankind have become capable of being improved by free and equal discussion. Until then, there is nothing . . . but implicit obedience to an Akbar or a Charlemagne, if they are so fortunate as to find one.   Indeed, Mill knows that authority has first to be created before we can go about limiting it. For without authority, however dictatorial, there is a fearful void, as we all know too well from Iraq in 2006 and 2007. In fact, no greater proponent of individual liberty than Isaiah Berlin himself observes in his introduction to Four Essays on Liberty that, “Men who live in conditions where there is not sufficient food, warmth, shelter, and the minimum degree of security can scarcely be expected to concern themselves with freedom of contract or of the press.” In “Two Concepts of Liberty,” Berlin allows that “First things come first: there are situations . . . in which boots are superior to the works of Shakespeare, individual freedom is not everyone’s primary need.” Further complicating matters, Berlin notes that “there is no necessary connection between individual liberty and democratic rule.” There might be a despot “who leaves his subjects a wide area of liberty” but cares “little for order, or virtue, or knowledge.” Clearly, just as there are good and bad popularly elected leaders, there are good and bad autocrats.  THE SIGNAL fact of the Arab world at the beginning of this year of democratic revolution was that, for the most part, it encompassed few of these subtleties and apparent contradictions. Middle Eastern societies had long since moved beyond basic needs of food and security to the point where individual freedom could easily be contemplated. After all, over the past half century, Arabs from the Maghreb to the Persian Gulf experienced epochal social, economic, technological and demographic transformation: it was only the politics that lagged behind. And while good autocrats there were, the reigning model was sterile and decadent national-security regimes, deeply corrupt and with sultanic tendencies. These leaders sought to perpetuate their rule through offspring: sons who had not risen through the military or other bureaucracies, and thus had no legitimacy. Marcus Aurelius was one thing; Tunisia’s Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, Egypt’s Hosni Mubarak and Syria’s Bashar al-Assad, quite another. Certainly, the Arab Spring has proved much: that there is no otherness to Arab civilization, that Arabs yearn for universal values just as members of other societies do. But as to difficult questions regarding the evolution of political order and democracy, it has in actuality proved very little. To wit, no good autocrats were overthrown. The regimes that have fallen so far had few saving graces in any larger moral or philosophical sense, and the wonder is how they lasted as long as they did, even as their tumultuous demise was sudden and unexpected.  Yet, the issues about which Mill and Berlin cared so passionately must still be addressed. For in some places in the Arab world, and particularly in Asia, there have been autocrats who can, in fact, be spoken of in the same breath as Marcus Aurelius. So at what point is it right or practical to oust these rulers? It is quite possible to force through political change, which leads, contrary to aims, into a more deeply oppressive, militarized or, perhaps worse, anarchic environment. Indeed, as Berlin intimates, what follows dictatorial rule will not inevitably further the cause of individual liberty and well-being. Absent relentless, large-scale human-rights violations, soft landings for nondemocratic regimes are always preferable to hard ones, even if the process takes some time. A moral argument can be made that monsters like Muammar el-Qaddafi in Libya and Kim Jong-il in North Korea should be overthrown any way they can, as fast as we can, regardless of the risk of short-term chaos. But that reasoning quickly loses its appeal when one is dealing with dictators who are less noxious. And even when they are not less noxious, as in the case of Iraq’s Saddam Hussein, the moral argument for their removal is still fraught with difficulty since the worse the autocrat, the worse the chaos left in his wake. That is because a bad dictator eviscerates intermediary institutions between the regime at the top and the extended family or tribe at the bottom—professional associations, community organizations, political groups and so on—the very stuff of civil society. The good dictator, by fostering economic growth, among other things, makes society more complex, leading to more civic groupings and to political divisions based on economic interest that are by definition more benign than tribal, ethnic or sectarian divides. A good dictator can be defined as one who makes his own removal less rife with risk.  While the logical conclusion of Mill’s essay is to deny the moral right of dictatorship, his admission of the need for obedience to an Akbar or a Charlemagne at primitive levels of social development leaves one facing the larger question: Is transition from autocracy to democracy always virtuous? For there is a vast difference between the rule of even a wise and enlightened individual like the late-sixteenth-century Mogul Akbar the Great and a society so free that coercion of the individual by the state only ever occurs to prevent the harm of others. It is such a great disparity that Mill’s proposition that persecution to preserve the existing order can never be justified remains theoretical and may never be achieved; even democratic governments must coerce their citizens for a variety of reasons. Nevertheless, the ruler who moves society to a more advanced stage of development is not only good but also perhaps the most necessary of historical actors—to the extent that history is determined by freewilled individuals as well as by larger geographical and economic forces. And the good autocrat, I submit, is not a contradiction in terms; rather, he stands at the center of the political questions that continuously morphing political societies face.\n\n\nGOOD AUTOCRATS there are. For example, in the Middle East, monarchy has found a way over the decades and centuries to engender a political legitimacy of its own, allowing leaders like King Mohammed VI in Morocco, King Abdullah in Jordan and Sultan Qaboos bin Said in Oman to grant their subjects a wide berth of individual liberties without fear of being overthrown. Not only is relative freedom allowed, but extremist politics and ideologies are unnecessary in these countries.  It is only in modernizing dictatorships like Syria and Libya—which in historical and geographical terms are artificial constructions and whose rulers are inherently illegitimate—where brute force and radicalism are required to hold the state together. To be sure, Egypt’s Mubarak and Tunisia’s Ben Ali neither ran police states on the terrifying scale of Libya’s Qaddafi and Syria’s Assad nor stifled economic progress with such alacrity. But while Mubarak and Ben Ali left their countries in conditions suitable for the emergence of stable democracy, there is little virtue that can be attached to their rule. The economic liberalizations of recent years were haphazard rather than well planned. Their countries’ functioning institutions exist for reasons that go back centuries: Egypt and Tunisia have been states in one form or another since antiquity. Moreover, the now-fallen dictators promoted a venal system of corruption built on personal access to their own ruling circles. And Mubarak, rather than move society forward by dispensing with a pseudomonarchical state, sought to move it backward by installing his son in power. Mubarak and Ben Ali were dull men, enabled by goons in the security services. The real story in the Middle East these past few months, beyond the toppling of these decrepit regimes, is the possible emergence of authentic constitutional monarchies in places like Morocco and Oman.  Both of these countries, which lie at the two geographical extremities of the Arab world, have not been immune to demonstrations. But the protesters in both cases have explicitly called for reform and democracy within the royal system and have supported the leaders themselves. King Mohammed and Sultan Qaboos have moved vigorously to get out in front of popular demands by reforming their systems instead of merely firing their cabinets. Indeed, over the years, they have championed women’s rights, the environment, the large-scale building of schools and other progressive causes. Qaboos, in particular, is sort of a Renaissance man who plays the lute and loves Western classical music, and who—at least until the celebrations in 2010 marking forty years of his rule—eschewed a personality cult. The characteristics, then, of the benign dictator are evident, at times hewing to propositions set forth by the likes of Berlin: freedom may come as much from stability as from democracy; leaders must adhere to the will of the people, they need not in all cases be chosen by them. Yet in the Middle East these dictators remain the exception to the rule, and this is why quasi monarchies of the iron-fisted Assad or the crazed and tyrannical Qaddafi are now under assault.  THE PLACE where benevolent autocracy has struck deep and has systematic roots is Asia. Any discussion of whether and how democracy can be successfully implemented might, because of the current headlines, begin with the Arab world, but the answers such as there are will, nevertheless, ultimately come in from the East. It is in those Asian lands that conventional Western philosophical precepts are challenged.  The ideology by which Asian autocrats stand in opposition to the likes of Mill and Berlin falls—to some extent—under the rubric of Confucianism. Confucianism is more a sensibility than a political doctrine. It stresses traditional authority, particularly that of the family, as the sine qua non of political tranquility. The well-being of the community takes precedence over that of the individual. Morality is inseparable from one’s social obligation to the kin group and the powers that be. The Western—and particularly the American—tendency is to be suspicious of power and central authority; whereas the Asian tendency is to worry about disorder. Thus, it is in Asia, much more so than in the Middle East, where autocracy can give the Western notion of freedom a good run for its money. The fact that even a chaotic democracy is better than the rule of a Mubarak or a Ben Ali proves nothing. But is a chaotic democracy better than the rule of autocrats who have overseen GDP growth rates of 10 percent annually over the past three decades? It is in places like China, Singapore, Malaysia and Vietnam where good dictators have produced economic miracles. These in turn have led to the creation of wide-ranging personal freedoms, even as these leaders have compelled people against their will on a grand scale. Here the debate gets interesting.\n\n\nIndeed, probably one of the most morally vexing realizations in the field of international politics is that Deng Xiaoping, by dramatically raising the living standard of hundreds of millions of Chinese in such a comparatively short space of time—which, likewise, led to an unforeseen explosion in personal freedoms across China—was, despite the atrocity of Tiananmen Square that he helped perpetrate, one of the great men of the twentieth century. Deng’s successors, though repressive of political rights, have adhered to his grand strategy of seeking natural resources anywhere in the world, wherever they can find them, caring not with which despots they do business, in order to continue to raise the economic status of their own people. These Chinese autocrats govern in a collegial fashion, number many an engineer and technocrat among them, and observe strict retirement ages: this is all a far cry from the king of Saudi Arabia and the deposed leader of Egypt, sleepy octogenarians both, whose skills for creating modern middle-class societies are for the most part nonexistent.\n\n\nPark Chung Hee, in the 1960s and 1970s, literally built, institutionalized and industrialized the South Korean state. It was Park Chung Hee’s benign authoritarianism, as much as the democracy that eventually followed him, that accounts for the political-economic powerhouse that is today’s South Korea.\n\n\nThen, of course, there is the founder of current-day Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew. In 1959, Lee became prime minister of what was then a British colony. He retired from that post over thirty years later (though he continued to exert significant power until very recently). As the British prepared to withdraw in the 1960s, Lee attached Singapore to Malaya, helping to form Malaysia as a bulwark against Indonesian expansionism. When racial tensions between ethnic Malays in the Malay Peninsula and ethnic Chinese in Singapore made the new federation unworkable, Lee seceded and the independent city-state of Singapore was born. When Lee assumed power, Singapore was literally a third-world malarial hellhole beset by ethnic tensions and communist tendencies; it was barely a country in any psychological sense and it certainly could not defend itself against powerful neighbors. Lee turned it into a first-world technological dynamo and transportation hub, with one of the highest living standards worldwide, and with a military that is among the best anywhere pound for pound. Along the way, a strong national consciousness was forged in the vein of a twenty-first-century trading state. Lee’s method of government was not altogether democratic, and his intrusion into people’s lives bordered on the petty and anal-retentive: banning spitting, the use of tobacco and chewing gum. The press, of course, was tightly controlled. Whenever criticized, Lee scoffed at how an uninhibited media in India, the Philippines and Thailand had not spared those countries from rampant corruption; multinationals love Singapore in large measure because of its meritocracy and honest government. Yes, Singapore is green with many parks, and so immaculate it borders on the antiseptic. But it is also a controlled society that challenges ideals of the Western philosophers.\n\n\nFor Lee has provided for the well-being of his citizens without really relying on democracy. His example holds out the possibility, heretical to an enlightened Western mind, that democracy may not be the last word in human political development. What he has engineered in Singapore is a hybrid regime: capitalistic it is, but it all occurred—particularly in the early decades—in a quasi-authoritarian setting. Elections are held, but the results are never in doubt. There may be consultations with various political groupings, yet, in fifty years, there is still little sign that the population is fundamentally unhappy with the ruling People’s Action Party (though its majority has fallen somewhat). Unsurprisingly, Lee makes liberals supremely uncomfortable. Fundamentally Mill, Berlin and many other Western philosophical theorists and political scientists—from Thomas Paine and John Locke to Francis Fukuyama of late—hold that people will eventually wish to wrest themselves from the shackles of repressive rule. That the innate human desire for free will inevitably engenders discontent with the ruling class from below—something we have seen in abundance in the lands of the Arab Spring. Yet, Confucian-based societies see not oppression in reasonably exercised authority but respect; they see lack of political power not as subjugation but as order. Of course, this is provided we are talking about a Deng or a Lee and not a Pol Pot.\n\n\nTo be sure, Asian autocracies are not summarily successful. Elsewhere, political Confucianism is messier. In Malaysia, Mahathir bin Mohamad lifted his people out of abject poverty and easygoing cronyism to mold another high-tech, first-world miracle; but he lacks virtue because of the tactics he employed as methods of control: vicious campaigns against human-rights activists and intimidation of political opponents, which included character assassination. The Vietnamese Communist leadership has lately overseen dynamic economic growth, with, again, the acceleration of personal freedoms, even as corruption and inequalities remain rampant. Think for a moment of Vietnam, a society that has gone from rationing books to enjoying one of the largest rice surpluses in the world in a quarter of a century. It recently graduated in statistical terms to a middle-income country with a per capita GDP of $1,100. Instead of a single personality with his picture on billboards to hate, as has been the case in Egypt, Syria and other Arab countries, there is a faceless triumvirate of leaders—the party chairman, the state president and the prime minister—that has delivered an average of 9 percent growth in GDP annually over the past decade. Nevertheless, Vietnam’s rulers remain fearful of public displays of dissatisfaction spread across the Internet. And there is China: continental in size, it produces vastly different local conditions with which a central authority must grapple. Such grappling puts pressure on a regime to grant more rights to its far-flung subjects; or, that being resisted, to become by degrees more authoritarian. So terrified is its regime of its own version of an Arab Spring that it has gone to absurd lengths to block social media and politically provocative areas of the Web.\n\n\nHERE IS the dilemma. Yes, a social contract of sorts exists between these citizens and their regimes: in return for impressive economic-growth rates the people agree to forego their desire to replace their leaders. (Truly, East Asian autocracies have not robbed people of their dignity the way Middle Eastern ones have.) But even as such growth rates continue unabated—to say nothing of if they collapse or even slow down—at higher income levels, this social contract may peter out. For as people become middle class, they gain access to global culture and trends, which prompts a desire for political freedoms to go along with their personal ones. This is why authoritarian capitalism may be just a phase, rather than a viable alternative to Western democracy.\n\n\nTo be sure, once the basic issues of food and security have been addressed, pace Mill and Berlin, democracy retains a better possibility of getting it right than autocracy. This is because virtuous autocracies are hard to come by and usually rely on the genius of personality; whereas democracy, regardless of the personalities involved, is systemically better positioned to lead citizenries along the path of development. Of course, we will have to wait until China’s economic growth slows down, or, failing that, continues until enough Chinese have more access to global culture. Only then can we really begin to draw conclusions about whether democracy represents the final triumph of reason in politics.\n\n\nThe genius of both Rome and America lies ultimately in their institutions, which allowed in the first place for their freedoms. True, the history of Rome—and particularly the death of the Roman Republic—is not in the least uplifting relative to the cause of political expression. But it was Rome’s ability to provide a modicum of stability to parts of central Europe and the entire Mediterranean basin—and thus further the cause of personal freedoms (mind you, by the dismal standards of the era)—that is key to its achievement; and something which, in turn, is owed to its imperial superstructure. And as that superstructure became too unwieldy, an emperor like the gruff soldier Diocletian could allow for the division of the empire itself into several administrative parts, thus furthering its life span. America, for its part, is unique in its division of federal, state and local power over a vast continental landscape, allowing for the full expression of its boisterous democracy. Say what you will about the deficiencies of the United States and particularly those of Rome, but they both indicate a very difficult truth central to the outcome of the Arab Spring: it is not about the expressions of freedom in Tahrir Square so much as it is about the building of legitimate institutions to replace illegitimate ones. And because institutions are hierarchical—and social media like Twitterand Facebookdismantle existing hierarchies—revolutions enabled by new technology do not necessarily lead to the building of governing organizations. Criticism is not enough, someone must wield power; hopefully in a way less coercive than before.\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Arab Spring has raised the pressure on autocrats the world over to truly be good—or at least better. Though, even if they are, they can never ultimately get it right, as demonstrated by Mill’s example of Marcus Aurelius.\n\n\n\n\n\nRobert D.

He comes to us once again from Beijing. We talked this time yesterday. Good to have you back. And we discussed yesterday what we would learn about that lineup of the standing committee. It hadn’t been revealed at that point that we spoke, but we now know and is it correct to say the most significant thing is no sign of a leader in waiting? RLK: I think the most significant sign is who the people are and how they relate to each other. It’s a group that actually respects traditional norms. RLK: There was thought that Wang Qishan, for example, might violate norms by being on the Standing Committee after the traditional retirement age and that’s not the case. There is balance among the member in terms of their geographies, even their political affiliations within the party which internally are important. Two are from Shanghai, two are from the Communist Youth League - one is actually from Shanghai and the Youth League as well but he’s really from Shanghai - two have a long relationship with General Secretary Xi. And then of course General Secretary Xi has the overarching power as everyone says - and that is correct and will be correct for a long time to come.  HOST: Absolutely, well certainly but breaking precedent by not having a young leader coming up behind him and we discussed this yesterday. The transfer of Mr. Xi will remain in power for many more years to come, perhaps revive the position of party chairman and stick around indefinitely. RLK: There’s no question about the power and longevity of Xi. I would put it a little differently. I’d say that it is not even necessary for him to have the party chairmanship or any particular title because of his overarching power by having his name associated with “Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era” - that whole phrase is now in the Party Constitution. Moreover, he already had the designation of “Core” of the Party. RLK: So those two elements – name in Constitution and Core - are totally overarching over any particular title. That said, not having a younger member of the Standing Committee who is an obvious candidate for future leadership, prevents there being a separate power center that could undermine what Xi wants to do. So the fact that Xi will be there until, potentially, the mid-2030s is very real. I think now we should shift our attention to what Xi Jinping wants to do. We need to look at the policies he is putting forth, and see what they mean for China and for the world. HOST: And I want to touch on that in a moment, but given this power and position afforded to him in the constitution no less, I mean where is room for discussion? 2 HOST: If not dissent at least a little difference in opinion when those who don’t agree with him basically, because he’s in the constitution, are against the communist party. They can leave or they can put up with it, no middle ground or perhaps question? RLK: This is a very interesting point and it goes to the party concept of what they call democratic centralism and collective leadership. When Xi was appointed Core about a year ago, which was a very significant move, the party also said it was reaffirming collective leadership. Now that seems on its surface an oxymoron, contradictory, but in the Chinese system it was not, and it’s good to understand why. RLK: Xi has overarching decision making power which he didn’t have before he was made ‘core’. But he is obligated under the system to respect the system - if he continues to do so, and I certainly expect he will - to really listen to all of the opinions of the senior leaders, certainly the people in the standing committee. And to conduct substantial research, reviews with experts, and polling and iterative kinds of research that they do for all their major documents. So he is obligated to do such serious consultation under the party system. Now can he subvert it the way Mao did? I don’t think that’s really possible even if he tried and I don’t think he will do that. So it’s a combination of him now having the absolute power, no question about it, but still respecting party norms of how they go about the research and decision-making process. 3 RLK: Now this will not mean overt dissent from the media. Certainly, that has been suppressed and will arguably for the foreseeable future continue to be. But in the inner circles, he is obligated to continue to seek guidance and get alternative opinions. HOST: Speaking of the media you just reminded me of something and we were having a lovely conversation yesterday. I don’t think either of was being particularly rude or anything. And let’s put up the video because you and I were chatting about, just regular Chinese politics and what was happening and this was what happened in our office. We were shut down by the censors in the middle of our conversation. What does that say about how things are going to be run? RLK: China is extremely sensitive during this particular time of the 19th CPC National Congress. They do that for all national meetings but this is probably the most central time. All elements of media are under strictures. Who knows at what level decisions are made? But even internet connections this week have been terrible because of extreme censorship. I expect that will lessen in the future. But it is endemic of the situation and we will all learn to live with it. As I said, there’s a larger picture here about what Xi is going to do in terms of his people orientation, rejuvenating China, comprehensively deepening reform, and strengthening rule of law. 4 RLK: We have to wait and see how that strengthening of reform and strengthening of rule of law is going to turn out. HOST: Indeed. I do have one final question because Mr. Trump is heading that way in a matter of days really. What does Mr. Xi make of Donald Trump? Donald Trump thinks they’re best buddies. What do you think Mr. Xi makes of Donald Trump? RLK: Before Trump came into office I know very specifically there were various think tanks that were engaging in various scenario planning on how to deal with Trump and his vicissitudes. RLK: And the conclusion was to let it play out, don’t react to virtually anything, and treat the U.S. just like it did in normal times. And so I think that will be the approach. It’ll be very straight forward. China won’t react to the highs or lows. It’ll treat the protocol at a very high level. And I think based on Trump’s personality that he will react well to that. The substance that comes out of that, whether it’s North Korea or trade, will have to wait. We could be quite skeptical about the substance of the results, but I think the form will look good. HOST: It’s going to be fascinating. Robert Lawrence Kuhn, great to have you on again. Appreciate your insights.

Trump proudly acknowledges he did not pay a dime in federal income taxes for years on end. He insists he merely exploited tax loopholes legally available to any billionaire — loopholes he says Hillary Clinton failed to close during her years in the United States Senate. “Why didn’t she ever try to change those laws so I couldn’t use them?” Mr. Trump asked during a campaign rally last month. But newly obtained documents show that in the early 1990s, as he scrambled to stave off financial ruin, Mr. Trump avoided reporting hundreds of millions of dollars in taxable income by using a tax avoidance maneuver so legally dubious his own lawyers advised him that the Internal Revenue Service would most likely declare it improper if he were audited. Thanks to this one maneuver, which was later outlawed by Congress, Mr. Trump potentially escaped paying tens of millions of dollars in federal personal income taxes. It is impossible to know for sure because Mr. Trump has declined to release his tax returns, or even a summary of his returns, breaking a practice followed by every Republican and Democratic presidential candidate for more than four decades. Tax experts who reviewed the newly obtained documents for The New York Times said Mr. Trump’s tax avoidance maneuver, conjured from ambiguous provisions of highly technical tax court rulings, clearly pushed the edge of the envelope of what tax laws permitted at the time. “Whatever loophole existed was not ‘exploited’ here, but stretched beyond any recognition,” said Steven M.

Carson, US Economist and Director—Global Economic Research, joe.carson@abglobal.com President Trump has promised to increase defense spending—and there’s support from key members of Congress. If a large multiyear plan is approved, it would represent a sharp reversal from what has beentheweakesttrendindefensespendinginthepast50years. And the timing and scale would have important implications for the outlook on growth and inflation. National Defense—The Trump Plan President Trump has promised to deliver an ambitious program to rebuild the US military. It would include modernizing US nuclear weapons systems, investing more in cybersecurity, enlarging the navy’s fleet and increasing the number of fighter aircraft for the air force. Trump’s plan also includes additional military personnel—well over 100,000, according to some estimates. The details of Trump’s first Pentagon budget will form part of the overall budget he’ll submit to Congress in late February or early March. The actual funding request for the current fiscal year (which ends September 30) must be completed by April 30—that’s when the current legislation funding the military budget is set to expire. More important, Trump’s blueprint for the Pentagon budget could set the baseline for defense spending for at least the next four years. It’s also worth noting that Trump’s military expenditures could be at the low end of what some in Congress are proposing. For example, Senator John McCain, who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, recently released a white paper on defense spending, Restoring American Power. McCain argues that the US has underinvested in the military for several years, and that it is now vital for the US to substantially increase funding for the Pentagon. His plan calls for a $640 billion defense budget for fiscal year 2018, which is $58 billion above the current budget baseline. Moreover, the McCain defense plan urges an additional $430 billion in military spending over the next five fiscal years. Defense Spending Patterns Are Unlike Other Federal Programs History shows that defense spending programs are unusual in that they’re neither cyclical nor countercyclical. Most often they are based on military and political strategiesaswellasongoingreadinessto respond to or engage in global encounters. Based on historical gross domestic product (GDP) data, there have been three large defense-spending programs in the past 50 years (Display 1). The first buildup Display 1 Defense Spending Comes in Big Waves YoY % Change 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 (10) Nominal Defense Spending Vietnam War Reagan Buildup Iraq War (20) 64 72 81 90 98 07 16 Trump? Through September 30, 2016 Four-year moving average Source: Bureau of Economic Analysis and Haver Analytics occurred in the mid-1960s, during President Lyndon Johnson’s term, and ran for five years. That was tied to the military engagement in Southeast Asia. The second large defense-spending boom occurred during the first four years of the Reagan presidency. This buildup was part of Reagan’s political and military strategy to rebuild the military apparatus after what he saw as years of neglect. The third major increase started during the first term of President George W. Bush. This one was linked to events surrounding 9/11 and the following events in the Middle East. 1 From a political and military standpoint, the Trump defense plan parallels the goals and objectives of President Reagan’s military push. And with McCain’s more aggressive plan aligned on the same premise of modernizing and improving the readiness of the US military, Trump will likely have the backing of this influential member of the Republican congressional leadership. Today’s Economic Backdrop— Similar to the 1960s The economic and financial implications of a large, multiyear defense-spending plan must be weighed against the economic environment at the time of implementation. And from a historical context, today’s conditions have more similarities to the economic setting of the mid-1960s than during the defense buildups of the early 1980s or early 2000s, which were either in recession or the very early stages of recovery. Incontrast,theUSeconomyinthemid- 1960swasalreadyinitsfifthyearof expansion, the jobless rate of 4.5% was relatively low and inflation was tame (roughly 1.5%). Nonetheless, the extra defense spending boosted domestic demand growth and added significant pressure to labor costs, materials and supplies, and product prices. So much so that the acceleration in consumer price inflation(from1%in1961tonear6%in 1970)fromthestarttotheendofthat businesscyclewasoneofthelargestof any economic growth cycle during the postwar period. Today’s economic backdrop looks similar in many ways. The economy has been in recovery for seven years, the jobless rate is in the mid-4% range and inflation is stable (at around 2%). While many domestic and global factors are different now, we would still expect a large multiyear defensespending program to add to growth and put upward pressure on labor costs and inflation in the coming years. Keep in mind that we’re coming off the weakest five-year defense spending trend in the past 50 years, so Trump’s defense spending need not match any of the prior three to have a major impact. Stay tuned for the unveiling of Trump’s budget and pay close attention to the defense spending request. A large multi-year program would definitely lift inflationary pressures. While we wouldn’t expect an acceleration like that in the 1960s, a sustained rise of 100 to 200 basis points in general inflation would still seem reasonable—and far above what the Federal Reserve and financial markets are currently expecting. n AllianceBernstein L.P. makes no representations or warranties concerning the accuracy of any data.

Carson, US Economist and Director—Global Economic Research, joe.carson@abglobal.com\nPresident Trump has promised to increase defense spending—and\nthere’s support from key members of Congress. If a large multiyear\nplan is approved, it would represent a sharp reversal from what has\nbeentheweakesttrendindefensespendinginthepast50years.\nAnd the timing and scale would have important implications for the\noutlook on growth and inflation.\nNational Defense—The Trump Plan\nPresident Trump has promised to deliver\nan ambitious program to rebuild the US\nmilitary. It would include modernizing\nUS nuclear weapons systems, investing\nmore in cybersecurity, enlarging the navy’s\nfleet and increasing the number of fighter\naircraft for the air force. Trump’s plan also\nincludes additional military personnel—well\nover 100,000, according to some\nestimates.\nThe details of Trump’s first Pentagon\nbudget will form part of the overall budget\nhe’ll submit to Congress in late February or\nearly March. The actual funding request for\nthe current fiscal year (which ends\nSeptember 30) must be completed by April\n30—that’s when the current legislation\nfunding the military budget is set to expire.\nMore important, Trump’s blueprint for the\nPentagon budget could set the baseline\nfor defense spending for at least the next\nfour years. It’s also worth noting that\nTrump’s military expenditures could be at\nthe low end of what some in Congress are\nproposing.\nFor example, Senator John McCain, who\nchairs the Senate Armed Services\nCommittee, recently released a white\npaper on defense spending, Restoring\nAmerican Power. McCain argues that the\nUS has underinvested in the military for\nseveral years, and that it is now vital for\nthe US to substantially increase funding for\nthe Pentagon. His plan calls for a $640\nbillion defense budget for fiscal year 2018,\nwhich is $58 billion above the current\nbudget baseline. Moreover, the McCain\ndefense plan urges an additional $430\nbillion in military spending over the next\nfive fiscal years.\nDefense Spending Patterns Are Unlike\nOther Federal Programs\nHistory shows that defense spending\nprograms are unusual in that they’re neither\ncyclical nor countercyclical. Most often they\nare based on military and political strategiesaswellasongoingreadinessto\nrespond to or engage in global encounters.\nBased on historical gross domestic\nproduct (GDP) data, there have been three\nlarge defense-spending programs in the\npast 50 years (Display 1). The first buildup\nDisplay 1\nDefense Spending Comes in Big Waves\nYoY % Change\n80\n70\n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n(10)\nNominal Defense Spending\nVietnam\nWar\nReagan\nBuildup\nIraq\nWar\n(20)\n64 72 81 90 98 07 16\nTrump?\nThrough September 30, 2016\nFour-year moving average\nSource: Bureau of Economic Analysis and Haver Analytics\noccurred in the mid-1960s, during\nPresident Lyndon Johnson’s term, and ran\nfor five years. That was tied to the military\nengagement in Southeast Asia.\nThe second large defense-spending boom\noccurred during the first four years of the\nReagan presidency. This buildup was part\nof Reagan’s political and military strategy\nto rebuild the military apparatus after what\nhe saw as years of neglect.\nThe third major increase started during the\nfirst term of President George W. Bush.\nThis one was linked to events surrounding\n9/11 and the following events in the\nMiddle East.\n1\nFrom a political and military standpoint, the\nTrump defense plan parallels the goals and\nobjectives of President Reagan’s military\npush. And with McCain’s more aggressive\nplan aligned on the same premise of\nmodernizing and improving the readiness\nof the US military, Trump will likely have the\nbacking of this influential member of the\nRepublican congressional leadership.\nToday’s Economic Backdrop—\nSimilar to the 1960s\nThe economic and financial implications of\na large, multiyear defense-spending plan\nmust be weighed against the economic\nenvironment at the time of implementation.\nAnd from a historical context, today’s\nconditions have more similarities to the\neconomic setting of the mid-1960s than\nduring the defense buildups of the early\n1980s or early 2000s, which were either\nin recession or the very early stages of\nrecovery.\nIncontrast,theUSeconomyinthemid-\n1960swasalreadyinitsfifthyearof\nexpansion, the jobless rate of 4.5% was\nrelatively low and inflation was tame\n(roughly 1.5%). Nonetheless, the extra\ndefense spending boosted domestic\ndemand growth and added significant\npressure to labor costs, materials and\nsupplies, and product prices. So much so\nthat the acceleration in consumer price\ninflation(from1%in1961tonear6%in\n1970)fromthestarttotheendofthat\nbusinesscyclewasoneofthelargestof\nany economic growth cycle during the\npostwar period.\nToday’s economic backdrop looks similar in\nmany ways. The economy has been in\nrecovery for seven years, the jobless rate is\nin the mid-4% range and inflation is stable\n(at around 2%). While many domestic and\nglobal factors are different now, we would\nstill expect a large multiyear defensespending\nprogram to add to growth and\nput upward pressure on labor costs and\ninflation in the coming years. Keep in mind\nthat we’re coming off the weakest five-year\ndefense spending trend in the past 50\nyears, so Trump’s defense spending need\nnot match any of the prior three to have a\nmajor impact.\nStay tuned for the unveiling of Trump’s\nbudget and pay close attention to the\ndefense spending request. A large\nmulti-year program would definitely lift\ninflationary pressures. While we wouldn’t\nexpect an acceleration like that in the\n1960s, a sustained rise of 100 to 200\nbasis points in general inflation would still\nseem reasonable—and far above what the\nFederal Reserve and financial markets are\ncurrently expecting. n\nAllianceBernstein L.P. makes no representations or warranties concerning the accuracy of any data.

The Trump  administration is keen to host  Modi. But South Block is look- ing at the potential deliverables  from such a visit, particularly  on H1B visas. The Indian PM's  political stature has increased  manifold after his recent elec- toral successes, while Trump's  presidential tenure has moved  from one problem to another.  Delhi doesn't want Modi to  invest his substantial political  capital to help Trump burnish  his image, without the visit  yielding positive results for the  Indian side. Modi is scheduled  to visit New York to attend the  UN General Assembly in  September. But, the Trump- Modi telephonic conversation  has indicated to South Block,  and to those who look at foreign  policy issues within the  Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP),  that the Trump administration  is keen to host the Indian PM  for a bilateral visit in the next  couple of months.  Earlier this month, Foreign  Secretary S Jaishankar, accom- panied by Commerce Secretary  Prime Minister Narendra Modi  Rita Teaotia, was in the US. Last  week, National Security Advisor  Ajit Kumar Doval was also on a  visit to the US. External Affairs  Minister Sushma Swaraj and US  Secretary of State Rex W  US President Donald Trump  Tillerson had also recently spo- ken over the phone.  In his phone call, Trump  congratulated Modi on his  recent state election victories,  expressed support for his eco- nomic reforms and said he had  great respect for Indians, and  said he looked forward to host- ing the PM later this year.  The window for such a visit is  available in May, as well as in  June after the PM attends the  Shanghai Cooperation Organ- isation Summit in Kazakhstan  in the second week.The PM's US  visit could take place before his  visit to Hamburg, in Germany, to  attend the G20 Summit on July  7-8, and his bilateral visit to Israel  around that time.  It will be the first-ever visit of  an Indian PM to Israel. The  highlight of his policy changes  will be the PM's outreach to the  Indian diaspora there. Israel has  85,000 Jews of Indian origin.  Jews are an influential commu- nity in the US, and some of  these groups had engaged with  Modi even during his time as  the Gujarat chief minister.  According to a source, Modi's  visit to the US before Tel Aviv  could help the PM engage with  the Jewish community there,  which would contribute to the  success of his Israel visit.  On Tuesday, the Indo- American Chamber of  Commerce urged an early visit  of the PM to the US to \"sort out  the apprehensions\" of the Indian  industry on the negative impact  of tightening of visa rules relat- ing to H1B and Li visas. \n\nBusiness Standard MUMBAI I THURSDAY, 30 MARCH 2017 \nAfter Trump phone call, govt weighs if Modi should visit US early \nARCH IS MOHAN \nNew Delhi,29 March \nThe Monday night phone call \nof US President Donald Trump \nto Prime Minister Narendra \nModi could pave the way for an \nearly visit of the Indian PM to \nWashington.

Today on Impact we bring you different perspectives, and one comes from Myanmar’s state media which claims the military has China’s backing for what it calls an “Anti-Terror Operation.” It claims the Chinese ambassador told hig- level officials that the operation should be treated as an internal affair. Let’s get insight from Beijing where we’re joined by Dr. Robert Lawrence Kuhn, a long-term advisor to the Chinese government and the author of How China’s Leaders Think. Robert, thank you for joining us here on impact, and what do you think is the Chinese interest here? RLK: China’s foreign policy is clear historically, but it has been changing under President Xi Jinping. President Xi has a grand vision to create an international community of common destiny, as he calls it, via a new kind of global governance. So, in this situation, what is China’s position? Historically, of course, China’s cardinal principle has been non-interference across international boundaries. But there’s much more here to the story. First of all, China will always skew to supporting the existing government - especially in cases of minority issues because China of course has its own minorities and would not want some new general principle of “responsibility to protect” to be used in an exaggerated way, because it could be applied to China’s situation in Xinjiang or elsewhere. RLK: But there’s more complexity with Myanmar because Myanmar an ASEAN country and China has great political interest in ASEAN, particularly in the South China Sea where Vietnam, potentially Indonesia, Philippines (for a time), were all claimants against China, and China needs support in that  area. In addition, Myanmar is in a critical geographic position for China’s economic concerns. President Xi has the Belt and Road Initiative, this far reaching strategy to build infrastructure across Asia and into Africa and even Eastern Europe. And Myanmar plays a critical position potentially for an oil or energy pipeline that would allow China to get resources from the Middle East and avoid the bottleneck in the Straits of Malacca. For all of these reasons, China would support the Myanmar government. Host: Robert, is China’s support strengthened by opposition from Washington where President Trump’s administration is calling for Rohingya refugees to return to safe zones? RLK: I don’t think that’s a big motivation for China. Far more important are local geopolitics, the Belt and Road Initiative, the potential energy pipeline. I don’t think China considers opposing Washington a major motivator for their strategy. U.S. comments seem normal for these situations, but are fairly ineffectual – look at Crimea or other places in the world where similar situations have occurred. RLK: Refugee crises are great tragedies for the world and it seems like we have more of them. There’s more of a desire for individual groups of people to assert their own independence. We see it in the Kurds, South Sudan, many places in the world. Perhaps it’s our interconnected world of 24-hour-a-day internet, which allows similar people to congregate together and take up their own personal interests. So it’s a very complex situation. China is dealing with it - for the reasons I said - for what it believes to be in its own interests. Host: Robert Lawrence Kuhn, thank you very much for joining us from Beijing.

I don’t think China considers\nopposing Washington a major motivator for their strategy.\nU.S. comments seem normal for these situations, but are fairly\nineffectual – look at Crimea or other places in the world\nwhere similar situations have occurred.\nRLK: Refugee crises are great tragedies for the world and it\nseems like we have more of them. There’s more of a desire for\nindividual groups of people to assert their own independence.\nWe see it in the Kurds, South Sudan, many places in the world.\nPerhaps it’s our interconnected world of 24-hour-a-day\ninternet, which allows similar people to congregate together\nand take up their own personal interests. So it’s a very\ncomplex situation. China is dealing with it - for the reasons I\nsaid - for what it believes to be in its own interests.\nHost: Robert Lawrence Kuhn, thank you very much for\njoining us from Beijing.

(The Washington Post) \nBob Woodward, an associate editor at The Washington Post, sought an interview with \nPresident Trump as he was writing \"Fear,\" a book about Trump's presidency. Trump \ncalled Woodward in early August, after the manuscript had been completed, to say he \nwanted to participate. \nOver the course of 11-plus minutes, Trump repeatedly claimed his White House staff \nhadn't informed him of Woodward's interview request — despite also admitting Sen. \nLindsey Graham (R-S.C.) had told him Woodward wanted to talk. He also started the \nphone call by saying Woodward had \"always been fair\" to him, but by the end he said \nthe book would be \"inaccurate.\" \nThis is a transcript of that call, with key sections highlighted and annotated. To see an \nannotation, click on the yellow, highlighted text. \nTrump: Hello, Bob. \nBW: President Trump, how are you? \nTrump: How are you? How are you doing? Okay? \nBW: Real well. I'm turning on my tape recorder, with your permission. \nTrump: Oh, that's okay. That's okay. I don't mind that at all. \nBW: I'm sorry we missed the opportunity to talk for the book. \nTrump: Well, I just spoke with Kellyanne [Conway] and she asked me if I got a call. I \nnever got a call. I never got a message. Who did you ask about speaking to me? \nBW: Well, about six people. \nTrump: They don't tell me. \nBW: A senator. I talked to Kellyanne about it two and a half months ago. \nTrump: [1. \nBW: She came for lunch. \nTrump: Well, it's too bad. Of course, you and I had a conversation a couple of years ago, \nand so that I think got you there a little bit. And we had a conversation many years ago, if \nyou remember, in Trump Tower. \nBW: Yeah, I do. \nTrump: That has to be 20 years ago. And you were thinking about doing a book about me \nthen, which is interesting. Who knew it would've been on this subject? Right? That was not \nin the cards at that time. \nBW: That's right. Well, I'm sorry, I... \nTrump: I still remember that. \nBW: I spent a lot of time on this, talked to lots of people. \nTrump: All right. Good. \nBW: And as you know and are living, we are at a pivot point in history. \nTrump: Right. \nBW: And I would've liked to have done that, and I maximized my effort, and somehow it \ndidn't get to you, or... \nTrump: It's really too bad, because nobody told me about it, and I would've loved to have \nspoken to you. You know I'm very open to you. I think you've always been fair. We'll see \nwhat happens. But all I can say is the country is doing very well. We're doing better \neconomically just about than at any time. We're doing better on unemployment maybe than \never. You know, I mean, if you look at the unemployment numbers, you've heard me say it. \nAnd we're doing better on unemployment than just about ever. We're having a lot of___a lot \nof companies are moving back into our country, which would've been unheard of two years \nago. If the other administration or representatives of it had kept going, had kept___you \nknow, if the other group had won, I will tell you, that you would have, I think you'd have a \nGDP of less than zero. I think we would've been going in the wrong direction. Because \nregulations are such a big part of what we've done, Bob. \nBW: Well, I understand that point of view. And as you know, it's also a difficult time where \nthe political system and you and my business is being tested. \nTrump: Yeah. Yeah. \nBW: I take it very seriously. I've done books on eight presidents, going back from Nixon to \nObama. \nTrump: Right. \nBW: And I learned something about reporting, frankly, Mr. President. \nTrump: Good. \nBW: I've got to go talk to people and see them outside of the White House and outside of \ntheir offices, and gained a lot of insight and documentation. And it's___you know, it's a \ntough look at the world and your administration and you. \nTrump: Right. Well, I assume that means it's going to be a negative book. But you know, \nI'm some___I'm sort of 50 percent used to that. [Laughter] That's all right. Some are good \nand some are bad. Sounds like this is going to be a bad one. \nBW: It was a chance missed, and I don't know how things work over there in terms of... \nTrump: Very well. We... \nBW: ... getting to you. \nTrump: Well, if you would call Madeleine [Westerhout] in my office ... Did you speak to \nMadeleine? \nBW: No, I didn't. But I... \nTrump: Madeleine is the key. She's the secret. Because she's the person ... \nBW: Well, I talked to Raj [Shah] about it. I talked to ... I talked to Kellyanne. \nTrump: Well, a lot of them are afraid to come and talk, or___you know, they are busy. I'm \nbusy. But I don't mind talking to you. I would've spoken to you. I spoke to you 20 years \n[ago] and I spoke to you a year and a half or two years ago. \n[Listen to Woodward and Trump's call on The Post's \"Can He Do That?\" podcast] \nBW: A couple of years ago, I understand. \nTrump: And I certainly don't mind talking to you, and I wish I could've spoken to you. But \nnobody called my office. I mean, you went through, I guess, different people.... \nBW: Well, Mr. President, how can I spend all this time talking to people and___like \nKellyanne and Raj and Republican senators? \nTrump: Who were the senators? No, they never called me about it. \nBW: Senator [Lindsey] Graham said he had talked to you about talking to me. Now, is that \nnot true? \nTrump: Senator Graham actually mentioned it quickly in one meeting. \nBW: Yes. Well, see. And then nothing happened. \nTrump: That is true. That is true. Well, that____no, but that is true. Mentioned it quickly, not \nlike, you know, and I would certainly have thought that maybe you would've called the \noffice. But that's okay. I'll speak to Kellyanne. I am a little surprised that she wouldn't have \ntold me. In fact, she just walked in. [to Kellyanne] I'm talking to Bob Woodward. He said \nthat he told you. \nConway: Yes. \nTrump: About speaking to me. But you never told me. Why didn't you tell me? \nConway: [inaudible]. \nTrump: I would've been very happy to speak to him. All right, so what are you going to do? \nBW: Well ... \nTrump: So I have another bad book coming out. Big deal. \nBW: ... it goes on, and I... What you can count on is that I've been very careful. And \nEvelyn, are you on? \nEMD: Yes. \nBW: Evelyn Duffy, who's my assistant, Mr. President. \nTrump: Hello, Evelyn. \nBW: She transcribed all the tapes because, with permission, I taped people for hundreds of \nhours. \nTrump: Good. \nBW: And I think there's nothing in this book that doesn't come from a firsthand source. Is \nthat correct, Evelyn? \nEMD: I believe that's \nTrump: But are you naming names? Or do you just say sources? \nBW: Yeah, well, it names real incidents, so ... \nTrump: No, but do you name sources? I mean, are you naming the people, or just say, \npeople have said? \nBW: I say, at 2:00 on this day, the following happened, and everyone who's there, including \nyourself, is quoted. And I'm sorry I didn't get to ask you about these ... \nTrump: I mean, you do know I'm doing a great job for the country. You do know that \nNATO now is going to pay billions and billions of dollars more, as an example, than \nanybody thought possible, that other presidents were unable to get more? And it was heading \ndownward. You do know all of the things I've done and things that I'm doing? I'm in the \nprocess of making some of the greatest trade deals ever to be made. You do understand that \nstuff? I mean, I hope. \nBW: Certainly, I understand and I would've loved to go through a discussion with you about \nNATO, because this goes back to early in your administration and your concern about it, and \nthe agreement that the countries have that they would increase their defense contribution, \nwhat is it, by the year 2024? And you know . .. So anyway, we are ... \nTrump: Well, you know last year, if you see the secretary, [Jens] Stoltenberg, he said I \nbelieve $44 billion just last year, and that was from last year's meeting. And this year it's \nmuch more money they've agreed to put up. So it's a tremendous amount of money. No \nother president has done it. It was heading down in the opposite direction. So I don't know if \nyou're going to report it that way; probably not. But that's too bad, but that's all right, but \nyou know, one of those things. \nBW: Everything is going to be factual. And it is not a good thing for my business, if I may \nsay this to you, Mr. President, to the presidency, or to the country, to not have real, full \nexchanges on these. And I broke my spear on it trying to get to you. \nTrump: Well, other than Lindsey [Graham], who did quickly mention it, nobody mentioned \nit. \nBW: You say Kellyanne's there, ask her. \nTrump: Nobody told me about it. Well, let me ask her. Why don't you speak to Kellyanne. \nAsk her. She never told me about it. \n[Conway takes the phone.] \nBW: Kellyanne? \nConway: Bob, how are you? Hi. \nBW: Hi. Remember two and a half months ago you came over and I laid out, I wanted to \ntalk to the president? And you said you would get back to me? \nConway: I do. And I put in the request. But you know, they___it was rejected. I can only \ntake it so far. I guess I can bring it right to the president next time. \nBW: Yeah. \nConway: But I try to follow all the protocols, or else I'm accused of being somebody who \ndoesn't follow protocol. \nBW: President Trump, I just want you to know I made every effort. \nConway: But you had talked to [former White House communications director] Hope \n[Hicks], right, who said no? \nBW: Listen, I talked to anyone I could. [Laughs] \nConway: You talked to a number of people and they all said no? \nBW: I talked to Raj. \nConway: Raj. \nBW: He was going to work it out. \nConway: Hope. IMe?]. \n[The president says something in the background that is inaudible.] \nConway: I said you tried talking to everybody? What about when you interviewed, like, \nother people? They all said yes? That they'd try? \nBW: Yeah, well, about six or seven people. I tried. And I couldn't have___you and I spent a \nwhole lunch on it, Kellyanne. And I said, I want to cover the substantive issues in foreign \npolicy and domestic policy. And you said you would get back to me. Nothing. \nConway: Yeah. So, I did. I presented it to the people here who make those decisions, but ... \nBW: Who are the people? \nConway: But anyway, I'll give you back to the president. And I'm glad to hear that you \ntried through seven or eight different people. That's good. You should tell him all the names. \n[Laughs] Thank you. \nTrump: But you never called for me. It would've been nice, Bob, if you called for me, in \nmy office. I mean, I have a secretary. I have two, three secretaries. If you would've called \ndirectly___a lot of people are afraid ... Raj, I hardly have ... I don't speak to Raj. \nBW: Kellyanne is a... \nTrump: I do, I do, and Kellyanne went to somebody, but she didn't come to me. \nBW: Well, does she have access to you? \nTrump: And she should've come to me. She does have access to me. Absolutely. She has \ndirect access, but she didn't come to me. And you know what? That's okay. I'll just end up \nwith another bad book. What can I tell you? \nBW: It's surprising to me that these people___did Raj have access to you? \nTrump: Not really, but he would've been able to do it. But I have an office. You have the \noffice number. I have an office that's directly into my office. \nConway: [inaudible in background] \nTrump: It doesn't matter. Let me tell you what matters: The economy is the best it's been in \nmany, many decades. And it's going to get a lot better. And the country is doing very well. \nThat's what's important. \nBW: Yes, sir. I thought I would ... \nTrump: We're doing a good job. \nBW: ... never kind of say, let's not talk about this because the book is done to a president \nTrump: Yeah, I know. \nBW: ... and, but that's the position we're in. And it's one I tried to avoid. You need to \nknow I made maximum effort. \nTrump: All right. It's too bad. \nBW: Yes, sir. \nTrump: I'm just hearing about it. And I heard___I did hear from Lindsey, but I'm just \nhearing about it. So we're going to have a very inaccurate book, and that's too bad. But I \ndon't blame you entirely. \nBW: No, it's r] ____ it's going to be accurate, I promise. \nTrump: Yeah, okay. Well, accurate is that nobody's ever done a better job than I'm doing \nas president. That I can tell you. So that's ... And that's the way a lot of people feel that \nknow what's going on, and you'll see that over the years. But a lot of people feel that, Bob. \nBW: I believe in our country, and because you're our president, I wish you good luck. \nTrump: Okay. Thank you very much, Bob. I appreciate it.

Nathan H. Lents and Robert Trivers  There is no shortage of published psychological profiles of Donald J. Trump that attempt to diagnose him, from a distance, as either a psychopath or a narcissistic sociopath. These profiles, of course, are fatally hindered by the lack of access to Mr. Trump for personal examination and completion of personality inventories. However, exploration of the evolutionary features of these very peculiar personality types may provide insight into this important question.   Psychopaths are indeed an evolutionary conundrum because their particular behaviors are not an obvious path toward evolutionary success. For example, the majority of serial killers are childless when they are killed or apprehended. Narcissistic sociopaths, however, invariably [typically] have families and children whom they support energetically, and many of the traits specific to this phenotype can fairly be called adaptive. This raises the important issue of the evolutionary niche of a narcissistic sociopath within the societies in which they exist.   The psychological profile of narcissistic sociopathy is generally agreed upon and shares many features with psychopaths including above average intelligence, considerable social savvy, adaptability, likeability, and natural skills in the manipulation of others. They are charming, outgoing, and often feign interest in people and subjects and can convincingly fake both sympathy and conscience. If they engage in charitable acts at all, they are only in pursuit of ancillary selfish benefits. They learn well from past experiences, and show no dedication to a set of moral values, religious beliefs, truth, transparency. If they admire anyone, it is other sociopaths that they wish to emulate. Finally, they are effective liars and show a chilling unconcern for the welfare of others.  There is one particular skill that is common to both psychopaths and narcissistic sociopaths and absolutely essential to their nature: cognitive empathy. Emotional empathy, sometimes called emotional contagion, is regarded as the ability and tendency to closely identify with the emotional experience of others, even “catching” their emotions to a degree. Cognitive empathy is quite different. This is a mental skill involving the close observation and interpretation of the actions and emotions of others in order to understand and predict their behavior. It is morally neutral and common in high-functioning individuals across the moral and ethical spectrum. While social workers and therapists use cognitive empathy to help individuals improve their lives, psychopaths and sociopaths use this skill to manipulate, coerce, and deceive others in order to achieve their own ends. While emotional empathy is an innate cognitive feature we share with most social mammals, cognitive empathy is a skill that can be developed and refined and doing so is key to the behavioral patterns of both psychopaths and sociopaths.  However, the ways in which sociopaths differ from psychopaths is key to understanding their evolutionary utility. For example, psychopaths are more likely than the general public to be violent and to end up incarcerated. Narcissistic sociopaths, on the other hand, are usually nonviolent and happy to work within a system of laws and norms, insofar as it suits their goals, because, while they do not hesitate to harm others, it isn’t a specific aim. Instead, they are highly motivated toward the accumulation of riches and influence; whereas psychopaths are often motivated toward sadistic self-gratification and generally do not seek positions of power and wealth per se. (There is some crossover between these phenotypes and sociopaths who do find gratification in hurting others are labeled malignant sociopaths.) Finally, narcissistic sociopaths always seek reproductive success through procreation and aggressive nepotism, which is usually accompanied by extreme in-group identification, e.g., racism, xenophobia, and nationalism, while psychopaths show no allegiance to family, community, or country.  Therefore, the phenotype of the narcissistic sociopath is not a bizarre combination of traits, but rather a set of highly attuned social skills and behaviors aimed at increasing long-term biological fitness through wealth, status, power, and the future success of progeny. In order words, sociopaths are highly adapted. The evolutionary puzzle is not found in the phenotype itself but rather in the interaction of sociopaths with the society in which they exist. Social groups can detect dishonest and manipulative behaviors and act to punish the actors in order to either correct the antisocial behavior or remove them from the group. Dozens of mammal species have shown this very sophisticated and elastic social behavior, but humans and our close relatives are especially apt at detecting and punishing cheaters, freeloaders, and liars.  This sets up both a short-term conflict and long-term evolutionary battle between manipulative narcissistic sociopaths and the rest of society, that is, those who do not wish to be manipulated. Most individuals in a society share a vested interest in maintaining fairness and social order. The equilibrium point is reached through a concept called frequency-dependent selection, the essence of which is that phenotypes can sometimes have distinct advantages precisely because they are rare. Under this paradigm, the infrequency of sociopaths in a population is essential to their success.    Current estimates place the prevalence of narcissistic sociopathy at 1-2% and scholars have held that this rate appears stable across societies and over recorded history (insofar as such a phenotype and its frequency can be inferred from historical sources). This makes sociopathy a candidate phenotype for frequency-dependent selection, especially given how successful they often are. The rarity of narcissistic sociopaths in the population, along with their considerable skill in hiding their true motivations, makes them very difficult to detect. If they were more numerous, however, members of society would become familiar with this particular pattern of social deviance and quickly learn to neutralize it. Furthermore, when narcissists encounter one another, while they may be willing to cooperate with each other in fickle and short-lived alliances, ultimately their goals will collide and the relationship deteriorates into mutually self-defeating conflicts. This, too, acts as negative selection and maintains the low frequency of this peculiar phenotype.  On the other side of the conflict is the selective pressure on the rest of society. Because sociopaths are rare, the intensity of the pressure on society to detect and neutralize them is correspondingly weak. Weak pressure leads to poor adaptation, while sociopaths experience strong pressure and become highly adapted. However, as the sociopath phenotype finds evolutionary success, the pressure flips back the other direction as the rest of society experiences increasing pressure, adapts, and then pushes the frequency of the sociopaths back down to the basal level. In human culture, this pendulum swings in both the long time scales of genetic evolution and the short time scales of cultural evolution. In both contexts, the conflict is cyclical.  With this evolutionary framework in mind, we can now return to the question of President Trump. Clearly, he attracts devoted supporters. When it serves him, he can be affable, charming, and flattering. He reads people well and can maneuver through his relationships in order to obtain the best “deal” for himself. While many question his capacity for emotional empathy, his skills in cognitive empathy are undeniable.  However, he also has maintained an unwavering pursuit of wealth, influence, and power, even by his own admission. He has never participated in regular religious observance, is not outwardly pious, and shows no allegiance to political party. It is well documented that his views have shifted, sometimes repeatedly, on the most central political questions of the day such as abortion, government involvement in healthcare, military interventionism, federal drug policy, and LGBTQ rights. While only his critics view him as racist and xenophobic, even his supporters see him as fiercely nationalistic and his own campaign slogan of “America First” underscores this. And finally, he aggressively pursues his own biological fitness through the placement of his children in top positions in both his business enterprises and his presidential administration. Thus, an evolutionary analysis reveals that he is clearly not a psychopath.  Whether or not he is a narcissistic sociopath, then, depends on the answers to questions about his conscience or lack thereof, commitment to truth and transparency, sincerity in his religious beliefs, fidelity to political ideals, and tendency to cheat, deceive, and coerce. These questions are more like Rorschach tests in which his supporters and detractors come to the exact opposite conclusions. However, for the most part, the answers to these questions do not require a psychological analysis of the President. There is abundant evidence in the public record.     \n\n                    Does Trump Fit the Evolutionary Role of Narcissistic Sociopath?\n\n                    Nathan H.

Finally, they are effective liars and show a chilling unconcern for the welfare of others.\n\nThere is one particular skill that is common to both psychopaths and narcissistic sociopaths and absolutely essential to their nature: cognitive empathy. Emotional empathy, sometimes called emotional contagion, is regarded as the ability and tendency to closely identify with the emotional experience of others, even “catching” their emotions to a degree. Cognitive empathy is quite different. This is a mental skill involving the close observation and interpretation of the actions and emotions of others in order to understand and predict their behavior. It is morally neutral and common in high-functioning individuals across the moral and ethical spectrum. While social workers and therapists use cognitive empathy to help individuals improve their lives, psychopaths and sociopaths use this skill to manipulate, coerce, and deceive others in order to achieve their own ends. While emotional empathy is an innate cognitive feature we share with most social mammals, cognitive empathy is a skill that can be developed and refined and doing so is key to the behavioral patterns of both psychopaths and sociopaths.\n\nHowever, the ways in which sociopaths differ from psychopaths is key to understanding their evolutionary utility. For example, psychopaths are more likely than the general public to be violent and to end up incarcerated. Narcissistic sociopaths, on the other hand, are usually nonviolent and happy to work within a system of laws and norms, insofar as it suits their goals, because, while they do not hesitate to harm others, it isn’t a specific aim. Instead, they are highly motivated toward the accumulation of riches and influence; whereas psychopaths are often motivated toward sadistic self-gratification and generally do not seek positions of power and wealth per se. (There is some crossover between these phenotypes and sociopaths who do find gratification in hurting others are labeled malignant sociopaths.) Finally, narcissistic sociopaths always seek reproductive success through procreation and aggressive nepotism, which is usually accompanied by extreme in-group identification, e.g., racism, xenophobia, and nationalism, while psychopaths show no allegiance to family, community, or country.\n\nTherefore, the phenotype of the narcissistic sociopath is not a bizarre combination of traits, but rather a set of highly attuned social skills and behaviors aimed at increasing long-term biological fitness through wealth, status, power, and the future success of progeny. In order words, sociopaths are highly adapted. The evolutionary puzzle is not found in the phenotype itself but rather in the interaction of sociopaths with the society in which they exist. Social groups can detect dishonest and manipulative behaviors and act to punish the actors in order to either correct the antisocial behavior or remove them from the group. Dozens of mammal species have shown this very sophisticated and elastic social behavior, but humans and our close relatives are especially apt at detecting and punishing cheaters, freeloaders, and liars.\n\nThis sets up both a short-term conflict and long-term evolutionary battle between manipulative narcissistic sociopaths and the rest of society, that is, those who do not wish to be manipulated. Most individuals in a society share a vested interest in maintaining fairness and social order. The equilibrium point is reached through a concept called frequency-dependent selection, the essence of which is that phenotypes can sometimes have distinct advantages precisely because they are rare. Under this paradigm, the infrequency of sociopaths in a population is essential to their success.  \n\nCurrent estimates place the prevalence of narcissistic sociopathy at 1-2% and scholars have held that this rate appears stable across societies and over recorded history (insofar as such a phenotype and its frequency can be inferred from historical sources). This makes sociopathy a candidate phenotype for frequency-dependent selection, especially given how successful they often are. The rarity of narcissistic sociopaths in the population, along with their considerable skill in hiding their true motivations, makes them very difficult to detect. If they were more numerous, however, members of society would become familiar with this particular pattern of social deviance and quickly learn to neutralize it. Furthermore, when narcissists encounter one another, while they may be willing to cooperate with each other in fickle and short-lived alliances, ultimately their goals will collide and the relationship deteriorates into mutually self-defeating conflicts. This, too, acts as negative selection and maintains the low frequency of this peculiar phenotype.\n\nOn the other side of the conflict is the selective pressure on the rest of society. Because sociopaths are rare, the intensity of the pressure on society to detect and neutralize them is correspondingly weak. Weak pressure leads to poor adaptation, while sociopaths experience strong pressure and become highly adapted. However, as the sociopath phenotype finds evolutionary success, the pressure flips back the other direction as the rest of society experiences increasing pressure, adapts, and then pushes the frequency of the sociopaths back down to the basal level. In human culture, this pendulum swings in both the long time scales of genetic evolution and the short time scales of cultural evolution. In both contexts, the conflict is cyclical.\n\nWith this evolutionary framework in mind, we can now return to the question of President Trump. Clearly, he attracts devoted supporters. When it serves him, he can be affable, charming, and flattering. He reads people well and can maneuver through his relationships in order to obtain the best “deal” for himself. While many question his capacity for emotional empathy, his skills in cognitive empathy are undeniable.\n\nHowever, he also has maintained an unwavering pursuit of wealth, influence, and power, even by his own admission. He has never participated in regular religious observance, is not outwardly pious, and shows no allegiance to political party. It is well documented that his views have shifted, sometimes repeatedly, on the most central political questions of the day such as abortion, government involvement in healthcare, military interventionism, federal drug policy, and LGBTQ rights. While only his critics view him as racist and xenophobic, even his supporters see him as fiercely nationalistic and his own campaign slogan of “America First” underscores this. And finally, he aggressively pursues his own biological fitness through the placement of his children in top positions in both his business enterprises and his presidential administration. Thus, an evolutionary analysis reveals that he is clearly not a psychopath.\n\nWhether or not he is a narcissistic sociopath, then, depends on the answers to questions about his conscience or lack thereof, commitment to truth and transparency, sincerity in his religious beliefs, fidelity to political ideals, and tendency to cheat, deceive, and coerce. These questions are more like Rorschach tests in which his supporters and detractors come to the exact opposite conclusions. However, for the most part, the answers to these questions do not require a psychological analysis of the President. There is abundant evidence in the public record. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNA\n\nFrom: \n\nTo: \n\nCC: NA\n\nSubject: \n\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 033328\n\nFrom: \nSent: \nTo: \nSubject: \n11/21/2018 7:26:45 AM \nTop Republicans slam Trump for indicating no strong action over Khashoggi killing - CNNPolitics \nImportance: High \nDoes the statement will help? \nhttps : //www. cnn. com/2018/11/20/pol i ti cs/top-republ i cans -sl am-trump-saudi -arabi a-khashoggi/i ndex. html \nRegards, \nSent from my iPhone \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 033328 \n\n\n\nNA\n\nFrom: NA\n\nTo: NA\n\nCC: NA\n\nSubject: NA\n\n011.- ....  ft JON/ U g a/ /7 2 et: 43089::.71 Fla 8:141:31, 41.21t) rw  /  ,//€,t/ feiltc v-5  Ho TELIS.RE  EXHIBIT \"C\"  FOR IMMEDIATE RFE VASE  For more information contact  Donald J.

By Kevin Rudd Mr. Rudd, a former prime minister of Australia, is the president of the Asia Society Policy Institute. May 29, 2019 When President Trump tweeted on May 5 that the China trade deal was off, the historical echoes in Beijing were loud and clear. Almost exactly 100 years earlier, China’s “May Fourth Movement” of 1919 was a direct response to the actions of President Woodrow Wilson at the end of World War I. Wilson had promised China, an American ally, that German colonies in Shandong would be returned to Chinese sovereignty, but instead handed them to Japan. China exploded with anti- American, nationalist sentiment. One of the eventual consequences was the establishment of the Chinese Communist Party, which for the last 70 years has ruled the country. Thus, Mr. Trump has handed Xi Jinping a remarkably effective nationalist card to play at a time when he has been under pressure at home because of a slowing economy. The Chinese media is now full of accounts of the country’s economic resilience and appeals to patriotism, even invoking the spirit of the Korean War, when, according to the official narrative, China was able to stare down the vastly superior American military. And just in case people didn’t get the point, Mr. Xi recently visited Jiangxi, the starting point of the Long March in 1934, in which the Communist Party endured many hardships but ultimately emerged victorious. I can almost hear members of the Trump administration groaning. Why on earth would they need to take into consideration events in China’s ancient past? The answer depends on what Mr. Trump’s primary objective is. If it’s to sound tough to American voters, he may well have a winning formula. But if it’s to bring about a substantive change in China’s negotiating posture toward a bilateral trade agreement, one that might usher in changes in China’s trade policy, addressing questions of forced technology transfers, intellectual property theft, industrial subsidies, currency manipulation and a phalanx of other non-tariff barriers, I’m not so sure. https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/29/opinion/trump-china-trade-war.html 1/3 5/29/2019 Opinion | Trump Hands China an Easy Win in the Trade War - The New York Times Days after the president’s tweets, China listed three “red lines,” positions the United States had taken in the trade talks that were unacceptable: First, that it would keep tariffs in place for a period after the proposed trade agreement was signed. Second, that it could impose punitive tariffs if it judged China to be in violation of the agreement, and that China would be forbidden from retaliating with its own tariffs. Third, the ever-inflating expectations of the terms under which Beijing would buy American goods under a proposed bilateral purchasing agreement. These “red lines” were new. Before that, China’s negotiating team had a fully flexible remit from the leadership. But not anymore. Now that these three lines are in the public domain, there is no way Chinese leaders can yield on them. The leaks of large parts of the negotiating text to the American news media has added a new level of toxicity, making it virtually impossible to return to the existing text as a basis of negotiations. Together with recent moves against the Chinese telecom company Huawei presumably intended to pressure Beijing further, the possibility of negotiating a revised agreement that is more accommodating to American interests is now very slim. Instead, what I have seen in Beijing over the last few weeks is a country moving in exactly the opposite direction. Related More on the trade war. Opinion | Michelle Cottle Donald Trumpʼs Great Patriotic Wars May 26, 2019 Economic analysts, meanwhile, have been calculating the impact of a full-blown trade war, estimating a loss of about 1.2 percentage points to Chinese G.D.P. growth. This figure is now portrayed in the Chinese media as entirely manageable given China’s capacity to use fiscal and monetary policy stimulus to support domestic demand and keep growth above 6 percent. Even if a trade deal with the United States is still possible, some in the Chinese leadership are now starting to ask, why bother? They argue that in technology, investment, foreign policy, national security and human rights, the Trump administration has made it clear that it has embarked on a more adversarial position toward China. So why should Beijing expend any more political capital on a trade deal? Perhaps it’s better, in China’s view, to cut its losses now and get ready for the next Cold War. https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/29/opinion/trump-china-trade-war.html 2/3 5/29/2019 Opinion | Trump Hands China an Easy Win in the Trade War - The New York Times If that’s what the Trump administration wants, its strategy has been a great success. If not, and the president really wants a trade deal, with reasonable decreases in the bilateral trade deficit, and some substantive changes in Chinese economic behavior, the American negotiating strategy requires some serious recalibration. Of course, China’s public position is that negotiations can continue. Even within the framework of the new “red lines,” there may still be room for a deal. China might agree to purchase more American goods, with America yielding on the retention of tariffs, and the unilateral right to impose tariffs later. However, the degree of difficulty in getting to an agreement has now increased substantially. The bottom line is that nationalism is not just a factor in Trump’s America. It’s now a big factor in Xi Jinping’s China as well, reinforced through the prism of Chinese history. In most of its dealings with America over the last 100 years, China has seen itself as weak. Today, in Beijing’s view, China is weak no longer. Kevin Rudd, a former prime minister of Australia, is president of the Asia Society Policy Institute in New York.

According to US media, Rosenstein was meeting with White House Chief of Staff John Kelly after reports surfaced that he had offered to resign in speculation of being fired.    Axios, citing an unidentified source with knowledge of the matter, reported that Rosenstein verbally resigned to White House Chief of Staff John Kelly. A second source told the news outlet that Rosenstein is \"expecting to be fired\" so he plans to step down.    The Wall Street Journal, citing an individual familiar with the matter, reported that Rosenstein has not submitted his resignation.   NBC News reported that Rosenstein said he would not resign and the White House would have to fire him.   Reuters news agency, also citing a person familiar with the matter, said Rosenstein had not resigned and is still serving as US deputy attorney general. The news agency reported that the unnamed source confirmed that the deputy attorney general had a previously scheduled meeting at the White House on Monday and that the Axios reports were false.    The reports come as Trump faces mounting pressure from the investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is looking into Russia's role in the 2016 presidential election.    Rosenstein assumed supervision of the investigation after his boss, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, recused himself because of his own contacts with Russia's ambassador to Washington while serving as a Trump campaign adviser became public.    There was widespread speculation that Trump would fire Rosenstein after a New York Times report on Friday said in 2017 he had suggested secretly recording Trump and recruiting Cabinet members to invoke a constitutional amendment to remove him from the office. The newspaper said none of those proposals came to fruition. Rosenstein denied the report as \"inaccurate and factually incorrect\". \n\nConflicting reports have surfaced on the possible resignation or firing of US Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees the special counsel investigation into Russia's role in the 2016 presidential election. \n \nAccording to US media, Rosenstein was meeting with White House Chief of Staff John Kelly after reports surfaced that he had offered to resign in speculation of being fired. \n \nAxios, citing an unidentified source with knowledge of the matter, reported that Rosenstein verbally resigned to White House Chief of Staff John Kelly.

Schultz threatens to split the vote for a Democratic party candidate, \npossibly throwing the election to Donald Trump. \nThe two legged Starbucks mermaid logo is so disturbing that I love to \ndraw it whenever I can. Here's the original Starbucks logo, that customers didn't like. \nThe logo was intended to depict the merger of two coffee companies, the original Starbucks and Howard Schultz's \ncompany, // Gomale that purchased Starbucks. Starbucks has a nautical theme to go with the character of Seattle. \n\"Starbuck\" was the name of the first mate in the novel Moby Dick. \nThis two legged, merger-mermaid is nasty, which makes it great fodder for cartoons. I drew the mermaid last year when \nthere was a racism scandal at Starbucks, leading the company to shut down for a day to do racial sensitivity training. This \nlogo-fish-girl would scare anybody! \nRead in browser »  \nJeff Bezos and David Pecker \nBy Daryl Cagle on Feb 08, 2019 06:04 pm \nHere's my new cartoon on the world's richest man, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, and the National Enquirer's (AM I) CEO David \nPecker, who was blackmailing Bezos. Pecker's AMI was extorting Bezos, demanding that the Washington Post (which \nBezos owns) hold back publication on their investigation of AMI, and that Bezos stop a private investigator he hired to look \ninto AMI — otherwise they would publish photos of Bezos' penis. Bezos was brave to expose Pecker's extortion. \nIt is interesting that Pecker and AMI seems to have such success with blackmail that his attorneys didn't step back to think \nof what would happen if the person they were blackmailing simply made their emails public. \nAMI is looking pretty sleazy these days, with likely links to Saudi Arabia, and a reported safe full of Donald Trump secrets, \namong other tawdry stuff. So, I took advantage of Pecker's dickish name and pulled Pecker's pants down. Some cartoons \nare fun to draw — even if editors won't publish them much. \nRead in browser »  \nRecent Articles: \nChinese Hackers!

You would not be \nable to do a competing book or documentary before then. This is not to say that they shouldn't be pursued. In \na sense, better that they know what Patterson's position is and, a year from now say, be able to counter it. I \nhave some thoughts on book and doc to share at your convenience. \nThat being said, you do need an immediate counter narrative to the book. I believe Trump offers an ideal \nopportunity. It's a chance to make the story about something other than you, while, at the same time, letting \nyou frame your own story. Also, becoming an anti-Trump voice gives you a certain political cover which you \ndecidedly don't have now. Still, this necessary involves you going public. And so the most basic decision is \nabout your willingness to do that. My view is that in a couple of weeks you could master message and \ntechnical proficiency. I know a bunch of people who could be very helpful here. This would involve something \nalong the lines of you writing an op-ed, doing a high profile television interview (Charlie Rose, I'd say), and \nperhaps some social media efforts. \nSpeaking of which, again, I think a strategic plan, involving your public identity, philanthropic activities and \ninterests, and the development of media allies, ought finally to be put in place. A big, comprehensive, \nexpensive effort. \nThe alternative is to continue to keep head down and hope Patterson book is just more he-said she-said and \nConnolly getting lost in the reeds (which, as an inveterate conspiracist, he always does). My worry is that \nPatterson can be counted on to produce a bestseller, and while he isn't regarded as a serious writer, he'll \nsurely be unloading a lot of tabloid copy. Because this will be tied to the election, the Trump-Clinton angle will \namp up the attention 10-fold, in fact, possibly, a hundred fold. Possibly more than anything you've \nencountered before. \nMeanwhile--\nIn a lawyer's letter, I'd suggest including the following points--not necessarily legal, but a warning about how a \npress campaign might unfold (publishers are more worried about being caught in negative media controversy \nthan they are of legal threats): \n1) Little, Brown has made on the record representations to at least one well-known journalist that it was not \npublishing a book by James Patterson about Jeffrey Epstein--possibly an effort to avoid inquiries about the \nquestionable nature of the book; \n2) The actual author of the book, John Connolly, is someone other than the stated author, James Patterson. \nConnolly is known to have developed an obsession with Epstein, such that, his longtime employer, Vanity Fair, \nhas refused to allow him to write about Epstein for the magazine; \n3) Sources have confirmed for us that Patterson has had little more than a minimal consulting role in the book, \nand that Connolly has functioned in every material way as the book's researcher and writer. We believe \nPatterson's \"authorship\" of the book will not stand up to scrutiny. And, indeed, that the entire notion of an \nextension of the Patterson franchise into nonfiction, as it has been used in fiction and children's book--\neffectively other authors writing under the Patterson name—presents a host of journalism ethical issues. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 033590 \n\n\n\nNA\n\nFrom: \n\nTo: \n\nCC: NA\n\nSubject: \n\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 033598\n\nFrom: \nSent: \nTo: \nSubject: \nAttachments: \n6/27/2011 4:45:11 PM \nEric Roth \nRe: Gulfstream V - offmarket, sleeper aircraft \nimage001.jpg \nof course i will speak send me his number, or have him call 212 750 9895 \nOn Mon, Jun 27, 2011 at 12:17 PM, Eric Roth wrote: \nJeffrey-\nI need to start off by stating that it is not my intent to go around Shawn Lancaster on this — Shawn is a friend. \nThis being said, I have received e-mails from both you and Larry this weekend. \nI called Larry and he said I should send you an e-mail. \nI called a close friend of mine inquiring about the GV market and aircraft that are \"not published\".
